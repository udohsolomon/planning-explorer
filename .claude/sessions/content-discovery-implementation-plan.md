## 🚨 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **ISR Performance at Scale** (10k+ pages)
   - **Mitigation**: Start with top 100, gradually scale
   - **Fallback**: Dynamic SSR for long-tail pages

2. **Map Performance** (1000+ markers)
   - **Mitigation**: Marker clustering (maxClusterRadius: 80)
   - **Fallback**: Server-side clustering, send pre-clustered data

3. **AI Content Quality** (1500-3000 words per sector)
   - **Mitigation**: Human review before publishing
   - **Fallback**: Shorter AI content (500-800 words) + manual editing

4. **Elasticsearch Aggregation Performance**
   - **Mitigation**: Heavy caching (ES request cache + app cache)
   - **Fallback**: Pre-computed aggregations (daily cron job)

### Medium-Risk Items
- Export functionality performance (large datasets)
- Freemium enforcement across all features
- Alert subscription email delivery reliability
