## ðŸ”„ Sequential Flow Rules

### Flow Control Principles
1. **Strict Ordering**: Each step must complete before the next begins
2. **Quality Gates**: Each step has defined success criteria
3. **Handoff Validation**: Clear deliverables passed between agents
4. **Error Escalation**: Issues escalate to master-orchestrator
5. **Documentation**: Each step documents decisions and changes

### Dependencies Management
- **Blocking Dependencies**: Must be resolved before proceeding
- **Non-blocking Dependencies**: Can be addressed in parallel
- **Critical Path**: Identified and monitored continuously
- **Risk Mitigation**: Alternative approaches planned

### Success Criteria
- All deliverables meet specification
- Quality gates passed
- Performance targets achieved
- Documentation complete
- Integration verified
