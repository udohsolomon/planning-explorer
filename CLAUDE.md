# Planning Explorer - AI Coding Subagents Framework
*Last Updated: September 2025*

## üéØ Project Overview
**Planning Explorer revolutionises property intelligence by transforming weeks of manual research into minutes of AI-powered insights.**

Planning Explorer is the UK's first AI-native planning intelligence platform that empowers property developers, consultants, suppliers, and investors to make faster, smarter decisions with unprecedented confidence. This project uses an advanced AI subagent framework to accelerate development through specialized agents working in coordination.

**Mission**: Democratise planning intelligence by making comprehensive UK planning data accessible, actionable, and intelligent for every property professional.

**Project PRD**: `Planning_explorer_prd.md`
**Framework Location**: `.claude/` directory
**Current Phase**: Development Setup

## ü§ñ AI Subagents Framework Explained

### Framework Architecture
**This is a CUSTOM role-switching framework**, NOT the built-in Claude Code Task tool. The agents are instruction files that Claude loads into context and executes directly.

**How it works:**
1. **Specialist files** (`.claude/specialists/*.md`) contain detailed instructions for specific roles
2. **Claude loads** these instructions and adopts that specialist persona
3. **Session tracking** via `.claude/sessions/current-session.md` maintains state
4. **TodoWrite** tracks progress natively (NO Task tool needed)
5. **Master Orchestrator** coordinates multi-specialist workflows

**Key Distinction:**
- ‚ùå **NOT**: Using `@agent-general-purpose` with Task tool
- ‚úÖ **YES**: Direct context loading and role adoption

### Master Orchestrator Invocation
To start a comprehensive development session with the master orchestrator:
```
Load and follow the instructions from @.claude/orchestrator/master-orchestrator.md
Analyze the PRD and coordinate the Planning Explorer build.
```

### Direct Specialist Invocation
For specific tasks, invoke specialists by directly loading their instructions:
```
Load and follow the instructions from @.claude/specialists/elasticsearch-architect.md
Design the enhanced ES schema for Planning Explorer with vector embeddings.

Load and follow the instructions from @.claude/specialists/frontend-specialist.md
Implement the Planning Insights UI design with shadcn/ui components.

Load and follow the instructions from @.claude/specialists/ai-engineer.md
Integrate the opportunity scoring system.
```

### Sequential Workflow Execution
For coordinated multi-specialist workflows:
```
1. Load @.claude/orchestrator/master-orchestrator.md
2. Create a development plan for [feature]
3. When ready, switch to @.claude/specialists/elasticsearch-architect.md
4. After schema is complete, switch to @.claude/specialists/backend-engineer.md
5. Update @.claude/sessions/current-session.md after each phase
```

### How Specialists Coordinate
**Session State Management:**
- Each specialist updates `.claude/sessions/current-session.md` with progress
- Next specialist reads session state to understand context
- Master Orchestrator reviews session and decides next specialist

**Native TodoWrite Integration:**
- Specialists use TodoWrite (not Task tool) for task tracking
- Todo items persist across specialist switches
- Master Orchestrator reviews todos to coordinate work

- **Agents Config**: `.claude/agents.md`
- **Master Orchestrator**: `.claude/orchestrator/master-orchestrator.md`
- **Specialists**: `.claude/specialists/`
- **Templates**: `.claude/templates/`
- **Workflows**: `.claude/workflows/`

### Common Commands
```bash
# Check project structure
ls -la .claude/

```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Agent Issues
- If agent doesn't respond: Check agents.md configuration
- If context lost: Review current-session.md
- If parallel execution fails: Run agents sequentially
- If token limit reached: Clear session and restart

### Development Issues
- Import errors: Check requirements.txt
- UI mismatch: Reference Planning Insights design system exactly
- AI timeout: Use ES native caching, not external cache
- ES errors: Verify enhanced schema with vector embeddings
- Supabase auth issues: Check Supabase configuration and connection
- Authentication errors: Verify JWT configuration and session management
- No Redis: All caching handled by ES built-in mechanisms

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Initialize Framework**: Create all agent configurations
2. **Setup Development**: Install dependencies and tools
3. **Start Building**: Invoke master-orchestrator
4. **Iterate**: Use specialists for specific features
5. **Deploy**: Use devops-specialist for production setup
