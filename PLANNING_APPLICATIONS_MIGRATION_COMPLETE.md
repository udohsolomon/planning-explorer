# Planning Applications Route Migration - Complete ✅

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Orchestrator:** Master Orchestrator
**Status:** Successfully Completed

---

## 🎯 Objective

Consolidate `/authorities/[slug]` and `/locations/[slug]` routes into a single unified `/planning-applications/[slug]` route for better SEO and user experience.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Strategic Planning & Analysis
- ✅ Analyzed existing `/authorities/[slug]` and `/locations/[slug]` structures
- ✅ Identified backend API endpoint (`/api/v1/stats/authority/{slug}`) already exists
- ✅ Created consolidation strategy combining best features from both routes

### 2. Frontend Implementation
- ✅ Created new route: `/frontend/src/app/planning-applications/[slug]/`
  - `page.tsx` - Server component with metadata generation and static params
  - `PlanningApplicationsClient.tsx` - Merged client component (27KB)

### 3. Component Features (Merged)
**From `/authorities/[slug]`:**
- Stats cards grid (6 cards: 12m total, all-time, approval rate, decision time, active, top sector)
- Chart components (monthly trends, approval breakdown, top sectors)
- Applications table with freemium gate

**From `/locations/[slug]`:**
- Enhanced hero section with gradient background
- Interactive map section (placeholder ready for implementation)
- Filter controls (date range, status, sector, sort)
- Related content links

### 4. Internal Links Updated
- ✅ `/frontend/src/app/authorities/page.tsx` - Updated authority card links
- ✅ `/frontend/src/app/locations/[slug]/page.tsx` - Updated authority links
- ✅ `/frontend/src/app/sectors/[slug]/page.tsx` - Updated top authorities links
- ✅ `/frontend/src/components/seo/SEOHead.tsx` - Updated canonical URL examples and functions

### 5. Old Routes Deleted
- ✅ Deleted `/frontend/src/app/authorities/[slug]/` directory
- ✅ Deleted `/frontend/src/app/locations/[slug]/` directory
- ✅ Kept list pages:
  - `/authorities/page.tsx` (directory listing still functional)
  - `/locations/` is now empty (can be deleted if not needed)

### 6. Testing & Validation
- ✅ File structure verified
- ✅ All internal links updated
- ✅ No broken references found
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean

## 📊 Migration Summary

### Before
```
/authorities/[slug]     → Authority-focused (stats + charts)
/locations/[slug]       → Location-focused (map + radius filtering)
```

### After
```
/planning-applications/[slug]  → Unified (stats + charts + map + all features)
```

---

## 🎨 New Route Features

### URL Structure
```
/planning-applications/{authority-slug}
Example: /planning-applications/aberdeen
```

### Page Sections (Top to Bottom)
1. **Hero Section** - Gradient background, authority name, breadcrumbs, badges, CTA
2. **Key Stats Panel** - 6 stat cards (elevated design with shadow)
3. **Charts & Analytics** - Monthly trends (line), Approval breakdown (pie), Top sectors (bar)
4. **Interactive Map** - Geographic visualization (placeholder for full implementation)
5. **Filters & Sort** - Sticky bar with date, status, sector, and sort controls
6. **Applications Table** - Recent applications with freemium gate (show 5, hide rest)
7. **Related Content** - Links to sectors, nearby authorities, popular features
8. **Footer** - Global footer component

### SEO Optimization
- Dynamic metadata with authority name
- Keywords: planning applications, authority name, UK planning, etc.
- OpenGraph and Twitter card support
- Structured data (GovernmentOrganization + Dataset schemas)
- ISR revalidation every hour (3600s)

### Performance
- Static generation for top 100 authorities at build time
- ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for others
- Client-side state management for filters
- API caching with 1-hour TTL
