# Elasticsearch Backfill Status
**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **IN PROGRESS**
**Task ID**: `2iqqEcptRFmrkMI7OWyjwA:887491140`

---

## Overview

Successfully started ES backfill to populate Content Discovery fields on all 2.3M documents in the `planning_applications` index.

## Task Details

**Index**: `planning_applications`
**Pipeline**: `content_discovery_enrichment`
**Total Documents**: 2,368,989
**Started**: 2025-10-02 03:00:04 UTC

## Progress (as of 03:01:00)

- **Documents Updated**: 217,982 / 2,368,989 (9.2%)
- **Processing Rate**: ~3,000 docs/second
- **Estimated Completion**: ~11-12 minutes from start
- **Expected Finish Time**: 03:11-03:12 UTC

## Fields Being Populated

1. **authority_slug** - Normalized authority name (e.g., "poole")
2. **location_slug** - Normalized location from postcode/area
3. **decision_days** - Days between start_date and decided_date
4. **is_approved** - Boolean from app_state (Permitted/Conditions = true)

## Pipeline Fix Applied

**Issue Fixed**: Date parsing error
**Original**: Used `ZonedDateTime.parse()` expecting ISO-8601 with timezone
**Fixed**: Now uses `LocalDate.parse()` for YYYY-MM-DD format
**Script**: `fix_ingest_pipeline.py` (executed successfully)

## Previous Progress Preserved

From failed first backfill attempt:
- **decision_days already populated**: 949,162 documents (40.1%)
- These documents will be re-processed with correct pipeline

## Monitoring

**Check progress**:
```bash
# Continuous monitoring
python3 monitor_backfill.py

# Single check
python3 monitor_backfill.py once

# Manual curl check
curl -k -u elastic:d41=*sDuOnhQqXonYz2U 'https://95.217.117.251:9200/_tasks/2iqqEcptRFmrkMI7OWyjwA:887491140'

# Field population status
python3 run_es_backfill.py status
```

## Expected Results

After completion:
- All 2.3M documents will have `authority_slug` and `location_slug`
- Documents with both `start_date` and `decided_date` will have `decision_days`
- Documents with `app_state` in ["Permitted", "Conditions", "Rejected", "Withdrawn"] will have `is_approved` boolean

## Next Steps (After Completion)

1. ✅ Verify field population with `python3 run_es_backfill.py status`
2. ✅ Test authority stats endpoint for accurate `avg_decision_days`
3. ✅ Verify approval rate calculations
4. ✅ Update implementation summary document
5. ✅ Mark backfill task as complete in session

## Known Limitations

- **Sector fields empty**: Requires AI classification (Phase 1 Week 2 - AI Engineer task)
- **Location stats unavailable**: Requires boundary data (future enhancement)
- **Approval rate may be low**: Need to verify against known authority rates

**Status**: Backfill running successfully at ~3,000 docs/sec
**ETA**: 03:11-03:12 UTC (11-12 minutes total)
**Monitor**: `python3 monitor_backfill.py`
