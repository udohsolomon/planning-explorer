# Report Generation Endpoint - Implementation Documentation

## Overview
**Date:** October 2, 2025
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Endpoint:** `/api/v1/report/{application_id}`
**Issue Fixed:** HTTP 404 error when frontend requests comprehensive reports

---

## Problem Analysis

### Issue Identified
The frontend was making requests to `/report/142216%2FNMC%2F2025` (decoded: `/report/142216/NMC/2025`) but receiving HTTP 404 errors because the backend had no such endpoint.

### Root Cause
1. **Backend State**: Had `/user/reports` endpoints for user report management but no `/report/{application_id}` endpoint for generating comprehensive reports
2. **Frontend Expectation**: Search results page was routing users to `/report/{application_id}` expecting a full bank-grade report
3. **Routing Mismatch**: Application details were available at `/application?id=...` (query param) but report generation had no dedicated endpoint

---

## Solution Implemented

## Investment Grade Classification

The endpoint uses a sophisticated investment grading system:

| Opportunity Score | Investment Grade | Description |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| 85-100 | AAA - Excellent Investment | Highest quality opportunity |
| 75-84 | AA - Very Good Investment | Strong fundamentals |
| 65-74 | A - Good Investment | Solid opportunity |
| 55-64 | BBB - Moderate Investment | Average risk-return profile |
| 45-54 | BB - Speculative Investment | Higher risk tolerance needed |
| 0-44 | B - High Risk Investment | Significant concerns |

---

## API Integration

### Endpoint Registration
**File Modified:** `/backend/app/api/v1/api.py`

**Changes:**
```python
# Added import
from app.api.endpoints import reports

# Added router registration
api_router.include_router(
    reports.router,
    tags=["Reports"],
    responses={404: {"description": "Not found"}}
)
```

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `include_market_analysis` | boolean | true | Include comprehensive market intelligence |
| `include_risk_assessment` | boolean | true | Include detailed risk assessment |
| `include_comparable_analysis` | boolean | true | Include similar applications analysis |

### Example Requests

```bash
# Basic report
GET /api/v1/report/142216%2FNMC%2F2025

# Report with all sections
GET /api/v1/report/142216%2FNMC%2F2025?include_market_analysis=true&include_risk_assessment=true&include_comparable_analysis=true

# Minimal report (application details + AI analysis only)
GET /api/v1/report/142216%2FNMC%2F2025?include_market_analysis=false&include_risk_assessment=false&include_comparable_analysis=false
```

---

## URL Encoding Handling

The endpoint properly handles URL-encoded application IDs:

- Frontend sends: `/report/142216%2FNMC%2F2025`
- FastAPI automatically decodes to: `142216/NMC/2025`
- Endpoint processes correctly with slashes preserved

**Example Application IDs Supported:**
- `142216/NMC/2025` → `142216%2FNMC%2F2025`
- `25/00427/FUL` → `25%2F00427%2FFUL`
- `PA25/00977/PREAPP` → `PA25%2F00977%2FPREAPP`

---

## AI Processing Integration

### Processing Mode
Uses **COMPREHENSIVE** mode for bank-grade reports:
- Full AI analysis with all available models
- Deeper analysis than FAST mode used for search results
- Higher quality insights with more detailed breakdowns

### AI Features Utilized
1. **Opportunity Scoring**: Detailed score breakdown with confidence metrics
2. **Summarization**: Executive summaries and key points extraction
3. **Market Context**: Location and sector-specific intelligence
4. **Risk Analysis**: Comprehensive risk identification and assessment
5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Application tone and language analysis

### Fallback Handling
If AI services are unavailable:
- Report still generates successfully
- Provides basic analysis without AI enhancement
- Clearly indicates AI features are unavailable
- Recommends manual review for full assessment

---

## Error Handling

### Application Not Found (404)
```json
{
  "detail": "Application '142216/NMC/2025' not found. Please verify the application ID and try again."
}
```

### AI Processing Error
- Report continues with basic analysis
- Error logged for monitoring
- User receives complete report with available data

### Service Failure (500)
```json
{
  "detail": "Failed to generate report: [error details]"
}
```

---

## Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Bank-grade report generated successfully",
  "report": {
    "report_metadata": {
      "report_id": "RPT-20251002103045",
      "generated_at": "2025-10-02T10:30:45.123456",

    "comparable_analysis": { ... },
    "financial_implications": { ... },
    "recommendations": { ... }
  }
}
```

## Frontend Integration

### Current Frontend Implementation
The frontend report page (`/frontend/src/app/report/[id]/page.tsx`) currently:
1. Fetches application data via `apiClient.getPlanningApplication()`
2. Fetches AI insights via `apiClient.getAIInsights()`
3. Fetches market insights via `apiClient.getMarketInsights()`
4. Assembles the report client-side

### Recommended Frontend Update
**Option 1: Use New Endpoint Directly** (Recommended)
```typescript
// Single API call for complete report
const reportResponse = await fetch(`/api/v1/report/${encodeURIComponent(applicationId)}`)
const { report } = await reportResponse.json()
```

**Option 2: Add to API Client**
```typescript
// In lib/api.ts
async getBankGradeReport(applicationId: string): Promise<BankGradeReport> {
  const response = await this.get(`/report/${encodeURIComponent(applicationId)}`)
  return response.report
}

// Usage in report page
const report = await apiClient.getBankGradeReport(applicationId)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Processing Time
- **Fast Mode** (search results): ~500ms - 1s
- **Comprehensive Mode** (bank-grade reports): ~2-5s
- Includes AI processing, market analysis, and comparable searches

### Caching Strategy
- Report data cached for 5 minutes by default
- AI results cached separately for reuse
- Market intelligence cached at service level

### Rate Limiting
- Standard API rate limits apply
- Professional/Enterprise tiers recommended for heavy report generation
- Consider implementing report quotas for free tier users

---
