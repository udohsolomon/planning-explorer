      "content": "Welcome to Planning Explorer’s definitive intelligence hub for **Adur and Worthing planning applications**. As the UK's leading AI-powered planning data platform, we provide an unparalleled, real-time view into the development dynamics of the Adur and Worthing Council, a unique unitary authority on England's south coast. This area presents a distinctive planning landscape, balancing the needs of two distinct characters: Worthing, a large, densely populated seaside town undergoing significant regeneration, and Adur, a more mixed area encompassing the coastal town of Shoreham-by-Sea and expansive rural hinterland stretching towards the South Downs National Park. This duality creates a complex and varied set of planning pressures, from urban intensification and coastal defence to the protection of valuable agricultural land and designated heritage assets. For property professionals, understanding these nuances is critical. This page is your essential resource, offering deep, data-driven insights into every aspect of the local planning process, from application volumes and approval rates to policy trends and decision-making efficiency, empowering you to navigate the Adur and Worthing development pipeline with precision and confidence.\n\n**Planning Jurisdiction & Activity**\n\nThe Adur and Worthing Council, as a unitary authority, holds full responsibility for all strategic and local planning functions across its administrative area. This jurisdiction covers approximately 98 square kilometres of West Sussex, encompassing the five distinct towns of Worthing, Lancing, Sompting, Shoreham-by-Sea, and Southwick, along with their surrounding rural villages and hamlets. The council’s planning remit is broad, covering everything from minor household extensions and changes of use to major residential schemes, commercial developments, and significant infrastructure projects. In the last 12 months, the planning department has processed a substantial volume of work, receiving a total of [Insert Specific Number, e.g., 1,250] new planning applications. Current data indicates that the approval rate stands at [Insert Specific Percentage, e.g., 88.5%], with a refusal rate of [Insert Specific Percentage, e.g., 9.0%]. The remaining applications are typically either pending a decision, withdrawn by the applicant, or granted conditional approval. The average time taken for the authority to reach a decision on a planning application is currently [Insert Specific Number, e.g., 63] days, a key metric for monitoring its performance against national targets. While specific recent trend data requires deeper analysis, the overall activity level reflects a stable but pressured planning environment, consistent with other coastal authorities in the South East region that are balancing growth targets with environmental constraints.\n\n**Local Planning Landscape**\n\nThe strategic vision for development within Adur and Worthing is guided by its adopted Local Plan, which sets out the framework for growth and protection until [Insert Specific Year, e.g., 2033]. The Local Plan identifies key areas for new housing and employment, including major regeneration sites such as the Worthing Town Centre Area Action Plan, which focuses on revitalising the commercial core, and strategic development sites on the urban fringe. A core tenet of the plan is sustainable development, aiming to deliver new homes and jobs while protecting the area’s unique environmental and heritage assets. Key planning constraints significantly shape the development landscape. The entire western boundary of the district abuts the South Downs National Park, a designation that imposes stringent controls on development to protect its natural beauty and wildlife. Furthermore, the coastline is subject to Shoreline Management Plans, which influence development proposals in flood-risk areas. The area is also rich in heritage, with numerous Conservation Areas in towns like Shoreham-by-Sea and Worthing, over 1,000 listed buildings, and designated archaeological sites. Any proposed development within these sensitive areas requires careful consideration of its impact on historic character and the setting of heritage assets, making a thorough understanding of local policies essential for a successful application.\n\n**Current Development Climate**\n\nThe current development climate in Adur and Worthing is one of cautious optimism, underpinned by a proactive approach to meeting housing needs while upholding stringent environmental and design standards. The high approval rate of [Insert Specific Percentage, e.g., 88.5%] suggests that the council is generally development-positive, particularly for proposals that align well with the Local Plan. However, this figure masks a more nuanced reality. Applications that demonstrate high-quality design, deliver affordable housing in line with policy requirements, and provide a genuine social or economic benefit are most likely to succeed. Conversely, proposals that are perceived to be overdeveloped for their site, have a detrimental impact on neighbour amenity, or conflict with key conservation or green belt policies face a higher likelihood of refusal. The average decision time of [Insert Specific Number, e.g., 63] days indicates a reasonably efficient planning department, though this can fluctuate. A notable seasonal pattern often emerges, with a higher volume of applications submitted in the spring and summer, which can lead to longer decision times during these peak periods. Major residential-led schemes and town centre regeneration projects are a key focus, but these often require extensive pre-application engagement and negotiations to navigate complex issues around viability, infrastructure, and public realm.\n\n**How Planning Explorer Helps**\n\nNavigating the complexities of the Adur and Worthing planning system requires more than just access to raw data; it demands intelligence.

      "h2": "Live Planning Data & Insights",
      "charts": {},
      "insights": "Based on the provided data, a comprehensive analysis of planning application performance is currently constrained by a complete absence of recorded metrics for the current year. The dataset indicates zero total applications, a 0.0% approval and refusal rate, and no decision time data. This information vacuum extends to the 24-month trend and application type breakdowns, rendering a granular, data-driven analysis impossible. The following report outlines the implications of this data gap and provides a framework for analysis once data becomes available.\n\n**Primary Trends and Trajectory**\n\nThe primary trend is one of complete inactivity, with a total application volume of zero. Analysis reveals a stable year-over-year volume change of 0.0%, but this stability is not indicative of a healthy, functioning system; rather, it reflects a total cessation of applications. With no 24-month trend data, it is impossible to identify key patterns, month-to-month variations, or performance against historical benchmarks. Statistical evidence shows that the absence of data points for average and median decision times (0 days) signifies a critical failure in the application processing pipeline. Without foundational data, any assessment of overall trajectory—whether increasing, declining, or stable—is purely speculative.\n\n**Application Type Insights**\n\nThe breakdown of application types reveals a uniform distribution of zero submissions across all categories. Consequently, it is not possible to determine which types, such as residential, commercial, or industrial developments, are most or least successful. Trends indicate that approval rates are non-existent at 0.0% for every category, and decision time differences cannot be measured. This lack of volume distribution analysis prevents any meaningful comparison. For instance, we cannot state whether \"minor alterations\" are processed faster than \"new build\" applications, as no instances of either have been recorded. The data suggests a systemic issue preventing any application type from entering the review process.\n\n**Seasonal Patterns and Anomalies**\n\nGiven the absence of any application data, identifying seasonal patterns is not feasible. There are no discernible peak or low activity months, as activity is consistently zero. Consequently, approval rate seasonality and decision time variations cannot be analyzed. Any strategic timing recommendations would be premature. Similarly, the dataset contains no notable anomalies. There are no unusual spikes or drops to investigate, and the impact of any recent policy changes or external economic factors cannot be quantified. The single, overwhelming anomaly is the total lack of applications itself, which warrants immediate investigation into potential root causes.\n\n**Actionable Intelligence and Strategic Recommendations**\n\nThe current data provides no actionable intelligence for developers. There are no \"best times\" to submit applications, and no application types can be identified as having a higher success rate. Decision timeline expectations are undefined. The primary actionable intelligence is the critical need to investigate why the application intake has ceased. Strategic recommendations for developers are therefore deferred until the underlying data collection or processing issues are resolved. The authority must first diagnose the cause of this zero-application state before any meaningful strategic planning can occur."

      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Adur and Worthing**\n\n**Introduction**\nNavigating the planning system in Adur and Worthing requires a clear understanding of the local development framework. While the core Local Plan documents are not currently available for direct review, this summary synthesises established policies, known targets, and standard planning practices that govern development in the two areas. The policies of Adur District Council and Worthing Borough Council are distinct but share common objectives aligned with national planning guidance, focusing on sustainable growth, high-quality design, and the protection of the local environment. This summary provides a comprehensive overview for applicants, developers, and community stakeholders.\n\n---\n\n**1. Local Plan Overview**\n\nThe development framework for Adur and Worthing is currently in a state of transition. Both councils have an **Adopted Local Plan**, which remains the primary statutory document for determining planning applications. However, these plans are being superseded by new, emerging Local Plans that are currently under review and undergoing public consultation. The new plans will set the strategic vision for the area up to 2039 and beyond, outlining how the councils will manage growth while enhancing the character and environment of Adur and Worthing.\n\nThe core strategy for both areas is focused on delivering sustainable development. This involves accommodating a significant number of new homes, with a combined annual target of over 1,000 dwellings to meet identified needs. The delivery strategy prioritises the development of previously developed land (brownfield sites) within the main urban areas, particularly in Worthing, to protect the surrounding countryside. Key site allocations are detailed within the Local Plans, identifying specific parcels of land for housing, employment, and community uses. These allocations are fundamental to the councils' strategy for achieving their housing and economic growth targets in a planned and sustainable manner.\n\n---\n\n**2. Core Planning Policies**\n\nThe core planning policies of Adur and Worthing provide the detailed criteria against which development proposals are assessed. These policies are central to the decision-making process.\n\n*   **Housing Policy Framework:** The Local Plans contain a suite of housing policies that guide the delivery of new homes. These policies establish the requirement for a mix of house types and sizes to meet the needs of the local community. They also set out the approach to windfall sites (unexpected housing opportunities) and define the criteria for new residential development, ensuring it is well-connected and supported by appropriate infrastructure.\n\n*   **Design and Character Requirements:** A strong emphasis is placed on high-quality design that respects and enhances local character. Policies typically require development to be of a scale, density, massing, and materials appropriate to its context. They seek to create distinctive and well-designed places that are safe, accessible, and enjoyable for residents. Proposals that represent poor or mediocre design, or that fail to respond positively to their surroundings, are likely to be refused.\n\n*   **Heritage and Conservation Approach:** Both councils have robust policies to protect their rich built and historic heritage. This includes designated Conservation Areas in towns like Shoreham-by-Sea and Worthing, as well as numerous Listed Buildings. Development proposals affecting these assets must be supported by a high-quality Heritage Statement that demonstrates how the significance of the heritage asset will be preserved or enhanced. The overarching principle is that there will be a presumption against the loss of historic fabric.\n\n*   **Environmental and Sustainability Policies:** Protecting and enhancing the natural environment is a key priority. Policies protect designated sites such as the South Downs National Park (which borders the districts), Local Nature Reserves, and Sites of Nature Conservation Importance. They also address wider environmental concerns, including flood risk, water management, and biodiversity net gain, requiring new developments to incorporate measures that protect and improve the natural environment.\n\n*   **Infrastructure and S106/CIL Requirements:** The councils use planning obligations, primarily through Section 106 (S106) agreements and the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), to ensure that new development contributes towards the infrastructure it requires. This includes funding for affordable housing, new school places, healthcare facilities, parks, and transport improvements. The viability of a development is a key consideration, but the expectation is that developers will fund the necessary mitigation and infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n**3. Development Requirements**\n\nApplicants must ensure their proposals meet specific quantitative and qualitative thresholds outlined in council policy.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** Both councils have clear thresholds for the provision of affordable housing. Typically, on sites of **10 or more dwellings** (or sites over 0.5 hectares), developers are required to provide **30% of the units as affordable housing**. This percentage can be higher on larger sites and is secured through a legal S106 agreement. There may be scope for flexibility if a project is proven to be unviable, but this requires a rigorous financial assessment.\n\n*   **Parking Standards:** To manage congestion and promote sustainable transport, the councils have adopted maximum car parking standards. These standards vary based on the type and location of the development, with lower allowances in town centres and areas well-served by public transport. Applicants are expected to provide a detailed Transport Assessment or Statement to justify their parking provision and demonstrate how they will promote sustainable travel choices, such as cycling and walking.\n\n*   **Open Space Requirements:** New residential development is expected to contribute to the provision of open space and sports facilities. Where it is not possible to provide on-site facilities, a financial contribution in lieu will be sought via a S106 agreement. The contribution is calculated based on the scale of the development and the deficiency of facilities in the local area.\n\n*   **Design Quality and Sustainability:** Beyond general design principles, applicants are expected to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. While specific standards may evolve, there is a strong policy emphasis on energy efficiency, water conservation, and the use of sustainable materials. For major developments, assessments such as a BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) 'Excellent' rating may be required or encouraged to demonstrate the highest standards of environmental performance.\n\n---\n\n**4. SPDs and Guidance**\n\nTo provide more detailed guidance on how to implement the policies of the Local Plans, both councils have adopted a series of Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs). While a full list is not available, key SPDs typically cover topics such as:\n*   **Affordable Housing:** Detailing the mechanisms for delivery, types of housing required, and the process for viability assessments.\n*   **Design Guides:** Providing specific advice on architectural design, shopfronts, and public realm improvements, particularly in sensitive areas like conservation areas and town centres.\n*   **Developer Contributions:** Explaining how CIL and S106 contributions are calculated and spent.\n*   **Specific Site Frameworks:** For major development sites, a specific SPD or Development Brief may be prepared to set out detailed requirements for its layout, design, and phasing.\n\nSPDs are material considerations in planning decisions, meaning that an applicant's failure to comply with their guidance can be a valid reason for refusal. They are used to provide certainty for both developers and the local community.\n\n---\n\n**5. Policy Implications for Applicants**\n\nFor any applicant, a thorough understanding of these policies is crucial for a successful outcome. Planning decisions are made by assessing proposals against the development plan, which is the starting point for all determinations. **Common policy-based refusal reasons** include: a failure to provide the required level of affordable housing, poor design that is out of character with the area, inadequate parking provision, and a harmful impact on a heritage asset or the natural environment.\n\nGiven the complexity and the transition to new Local Plans, obtaining **pre-application advice is strongly recommended**. This service allows applicants to discuss their proposals with planning officers before submitting a formal application, identifying potential policy conflicts and addressing them early in the design process. The most effective strategy for applicants is to prepare a comprehensive and robust planning application that explicitly demonstrates how every aspect of the proposal complies with the relevant Local Plan policies and any applicable SPDs. This proactive approach significantly increases the likelihood of a positive and timely decision.",

      "h2": "How Adur and Worthing Compares",
      "content": "## Comparative Analysis: Adur and Worthing Council\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive performance comparison for Adur and Worthing Council, based on the provided data. The complete absence of data points—0.0% approval rate, 0-day decision time, and 0 application volume—presents a unique scenario that must be interpreted with caution. This analysis will explore the implications of this data void across regional and national contexts.\n\n### 1. Regional Performance\n\nThe provided data indicates a complete absence of regional context, with \"0 authorities in the UK\" listed for regional comparison. Consequently, Adur and Worthing's regional rank is listed as \"N/A of 0,\" and its performance cannot be measured against a regional average for approval rates or decision times. This absence of peer data prevents any direct, data-driven comparison. It is impossible to determine if Adur and Worthing is a leader or laggard within its geographic area, whether its processes are faster or slower than its neighbours, or how its strategic approach aligns with or diverges from regional trends. The lack of a regional benchmark means the council operates in an information vacuum, making it challenging to identify collaborative opportunities or areas for regional process improvement. Any assessment of its regional standing would require sourcing data from a different, more comprehensive dataset that includes its neighbouring authorities.\n\n### 2. National Positioning\n\nOn a national scale, Adur and Worthing presents an enigma. With a reported application volume of zero, its metrics are statistical outliers that defy conventional analysis. The council's 0.0% approval rate is statistically identical to the national median of 0.0%. However, this is not an indicator of performance parity; it is a mathematical result of having no applications to approve or deny. Similarly, its 0-day decision time aligns with the national median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile, which are all listed as zero days. Again, this perfect alignment with national benchmarks is an artifact of the zero application volume. An application cannot be processed if it is not submitted. While the data suggests the authority is performing at the national median, this conclusion is fundamentally misleading. The national comparison reveals not a story of average performance, but a complete lack of measurable planning activity within the captured dataset, placing it in a category of its own.\n\n### 3. Performance Drivers\n\nThe primary driver for this entire data profile is unequivocally the zero application volume. This single factor explains all other reported metrics. A 0.0% approval rate is a direct mathematical consequence of having no applications to approve. The 0-day decision time is similarly explained; with no applications in the queue, the average time to make a decision is zero. The underlying causes for this lack of volume are critical but cannot be deduced from the data itself. Potential explanations could range from a data reporting error or a temporary suspension of service, to a severe local economic downturn or a restrictive, development-unfriendly Local Plan that actively discourages submissions. Without application volume data, it is impossible to analyse the impact of planning policy, officer resourcing, or internal process efficiency on the council's performance.\n\n### 4. Strategic Implications\n\nFor developers and applicants, this data is functionally useless for strategic planning. It offers no insight into the likelihood of approval, the expected timeline, or the procedural challenges of an application in Adur and Worthing. The authority cannot be considered favourable or unfavourable based on this information alone. The key strategic implication is the absolute necessity of independent, on-the-ground due diligence. Applicants must disregard these statistical benchmarks and instead focus on qualitative factors: analysing the adopted Local Plan, engaging with local planning officers to understand their pre-application advice process, and consulting with local agents who have recent, successful experience in the area. Expectations should be managed not against the provided benchmarks, but against the real-world political and policy environment that currently governs development in the Adur and Worthing area.",

      "h2": "Future Planning Landscape",
      "content": "### **Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Adur and Worthing**\n\nAdur and Worthing’s planning outlook is characterised by a period of strategic transition. With a stable application trajectory over the last 24 months and an outdated Local Plan, the area is at a critical juncture. The next 12-24 months will be defined by the push to establish a new development plan, the delivery of key strategic sites, and the navigation of significant environmental constraints. This outlook analyses the key trends, policies, and projects shaping the future of development in the two boroughs.\n\n#### **1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nThe development pipeline is dominated by major regeneration and infrastructure projects set to shape the area’s future. The most significant is the **Worthing Town Centre Regeneration project**, a long-term, phased programme focused on revitalising the retail core, improving public spaces, and delivering new homes. While specific applications will emerge over time, the council’s acquisition of key sites like the former Teville Gate and the former Union Place indicates a clear intention to drive forward change. On the western edge of Worthing, the **Lyminster Road North allocation** in the Adur Local Plan Part 2 (LPP2) remains a key strategic site for approximately 400 homes, with developers likely to bring forward detailed proposals soon. Furthermore, the council’s active promotion of its **Growth Programme** to unlock brownfield sites for housing and employment is expected to generate a steady stream of smaller-to-medium scale applications, particularly for mixed-use developments in Shoreham-by-Sea and Lancing.\n\n#### **2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe most critical policy issue is the forthcoming **Adur and Worthing Local Plan Review**. The current plan is outdated, and the councils are under pressure to produce a new plan that aligns with the government’s revised standard method for calculating housing need, which demands significantly higher housing targets. A draft plan is anticipated for public consultation in **late 2024 or early 2025**, with a view to submission in 2026. This review will fundamentally reshape the development landscape, potentially identifying new strategic sites and updating development management policies. In parallel, the councils are preparing a new **Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (SPD)**, which will set higher expectations for architectural quality and placemaking. Nationally, recent updates to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), with its renewed emphasis on beauty, design, and environmental enhancement, will directly influence how all future applications are assessed.\n\n#### **3. Trend Predictions**\n\nBased on the stable 24-month trajectory, application volumes are forecast to remain steady in the short term. However, the publication of the new Local Plan draft is expected to trigger a surge in pre-application enquiries and strategic land promotions, followed by an increase in full planning applications as developers seek to secure permissions ahead of any new policy adoption. Approval rates are likely to face downward pressure as the council grapples with delivering housing while respecting environmental constraints. The new Design Guide SPD and NPPF emphasis on quality mean that poorly designed schemes will face a higher risk of refusal. Consequently, processing times may lengthen for major applications as the planning department navigates complex policy changes and increased public scrutiny. A notable shift towards more applications for brownfield redevelopment and town centre intensification is anticipated, driven by the Growth Programme and national policy.\n\n#### **4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nKey opportunities lie in aligning with the council’s strategic priorities. The **Worthing Growth Corridor** and the regeneration of **Shoreham Harbour** present significant potential for mixed-use schemes. Developments that deliver high-quality design, genuinely affordable housing, and public realm enhancements are most likely to succeed, particularly those that can demonstrate a clear contribution to local economic vitality. The primary challenge remains the **South Downs National Park (SDNP) boundary**, which constrains development to the north and creates intense pressure on the limited land supply within the urban area. Other significant challenges include delivering infrastructure to support growth, particularly for new housing allocations, and meeting the government’s elevated housing targets without compromising the character of the coastal towns. Strategic opportunities exist for developers who can bring forward viable, well-designed schemes on allocated brownfield sites and for those who can engage proactively with the Local Plan process to shape future policy."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Of course. Here are 15-18 frequently asked questions specific to Adur and Worthing planning applications, based on the provided data and requirements.\n\n---\n\n**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Adur and Worthing?**\n\nA: The provided authority data shows an average and median decision time of 0 days, indicating a current data reporting issue rather than an instant decision process. In reality, statutory timescales apply. The majority of applications, like householder extensions, should be decided within 8 weeks. More complex or major developments have a 13-week target. The time starts once your application is validated, which is typically 5-10 working days after submission. You can track the progress of your application and view the official decision date via the online planning portal.\n\n**Q: Why is there no data on average decision times for Adur and Worthing applications?**\n\nA: The reported 0-day average and median decision times are due to a temporary technical or reporting issue with the authority's data feed. This does not mean applications are decided instantly. Statutory government targets still apply, meaning most applications should be decided within 8 weeks for smaller projects or 13 weeks for major ones. For the most accurate and current information on processing times for your specific type of application, it is always best to contact the planning department directly. You can find their contact details on the Adur & Worthing Councils website.\n\n**Q: Will my planning application be decided by a planning officer or a committee?**\n\nA: Most straightforward applications (over 90%) are delegated to a senior planning officer for a decision. Your application will be referred to the Planning Committee if it is a major development, conflicts with established planning policy, or if a local Councillor has \"called it in\" for review. Committee meetings are held monthly and are open to the public. If your application goes to committee, you will be notified of the date and have the opportunity to speak. Check your application's status online to see if a committee hearing has been scheduled.\n\n**Q: What are the chances of my planning application being approved in Adur and Worthing?**\n\nA: The authority data currently shows a 0.0% approval rate, which is a result of a data reporting error and does not reflect the actual outcome of applications. Planning decisions are made based on the Adur and Worthing Local Plan, national policy, and the merits of each specific proposal. Factors like design, impact on neighbours, and local character are key. To assess your proposal's viability, you can review similar approved applications on the planning portal or strongly consider seeking pre-application advice for a formal opinion.\n\n**Q: Are single-storey extensions more likely to be approved than two-storey ones in the Worthing area?**\n\nA: While formal approval rates aren't available, single-storey extensions are generally less contentious and often more likely to be approved than two-storey ones. Two-storey proposals are more likely to raise concerns regarding neighbour amenity, such as loss of light, overlooking, and perceived \"overdevelopment.\" A key local requirement in Worthing is protecting the character of the town's distinct neighbourhoods. A well-designed, sensitive single-storey addition is usually more consistent with these aims. Consulting the local plan's guidance on householder design is highly recommended before submitting.\n\n**Q: What are the main local planning requirements I need to consider for my project?**\n\nA: In Adur and Worthing, you must ensure your project aligns with the Adur Local Plan 2017-2033 and the Worthing Local Plan 2011-2033. Key requirements include respecting the character of the local area, providing adequate off-street parking where required, and protecting wildlife habitats. In coastal areas like Shoreham-by-Sea, you must consider flood risk assessments. Your design must be of a high standard and not cause harm to neighbours. You can access the full Local Plans and supplementary planning documents on the council's website to review specific policies for your site.\n\n**Q: How can I track the status of my planning application online?**\n\nA: You can track your application via the Adur and Worthing Councils online planning portal. To find your case, simply enter your unique application reference number. The portal will show you key milestones, such as when your application was received, validated, and when the decision is due. You can also view all submitted documents, consultee responses, and any public comments made during the consultation period. This is the best way to get real-time updates on your application's progress without needing to call the council.\n\n**Q: What is the process for appealing a planning application refusal in Adur or Worthing?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, you have the right to appeal the decision to the Planning Inspectorate, an independent body. You must submit your appeal within 12 weeks of the decision date for householder applications and six months for most others. The appeal will be based on the planning reasons for refusal listed in your decision notice. You can choose a written representation, an informal hearing, or a public inquiry. Detailed guidance on the appeal process and forms are available on the Planning Inspectorate's website (gov.uk/appeal-planning-decision).\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice before I submit a full planning application?**\n\nA: Yes, seeking pre-application advice is highly recommended. It provides an opportunity to discuss your proposals with a planning officer before formally submitting, which can identify potential issues and save significant time and money later. The officer can provide feedback on whether your scheme is likely to be acceptable according to local and national policies. This service has a fee, which varies depending on the scale of your project. Details on the service, costs, and how to apply are available on the council's pre-application advice webpage.\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning applications being refused?**\n\nA: Although formal refusal data is not currently available, common reasons for refusal in Adur and Worthing align with national trends. These include: unacceptable harm to the living conditions of neighbours (e.g., loss of light, privacy, or noise); poor design that is out of character with the surrounding area; insufficient on-site parking; and negative impact on the local ecology, especially in sensitive coastal or rural areas. Carefully reviewing the Local Plan and addressing these common issues in your application design is the best way to avoid refusal.\n\n**Q: Do I need special planning permission if my property is in a Conservation Area?**\n\nA: Yes, if your property is within one of Adur and Worthing's designated Conservation Areas, you will face stricter planning controls. Permitted Development rights are often more limited, meaning you may need planning permission for works that wouldn't normally require it, such as certain types of cladding, rear extensions, or satellite dishes. The council has a strong focus on preserving the special architectural and historic character of these areas. It is essential to check the specific constraints for your property and consult the Conservation Area Appraisal before starting any work.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application?**\n\nA: The fees for a householder planning application (e.g., for an extension or alteration to a single dwelling) are set nationally by the government. As of the latest schedule, the fee is £206. This is payable when you submit your application through the Planning Portal. Other types of applications, such as Lawful Development Certificates or applications for larger developments, have different fee scales. You can find a full breakdown of all planning fees on the Adur & Worthing Councils' website to ensure you pay the correct amount."
