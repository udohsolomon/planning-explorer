      "content": "Welcome to the definitive resource for planning intelligence in Cheltenham, provided by Planning Explorer, the UK's leading AI-powered planning data platform. This page offers unparalleled, data-driven insights into Cheltenham planning applications, transforming complex planning data into actionable intelligence for property professionals. As the administrative centre of the Cotswolds and a major town in the South West, Cheltenham presents a unique and dynamic planning environment. It is characterised by a rich Regency heritage, a thriving economy anchored by the cyber security and festival sectors, and a distinctive geography that blends elegant urban streetscapes with accessible rural surroundings. These factors create a complex interplay of opportunities and constraints, from the sensitive redevelopment of historic town centre assets to sustainable urban expansion on its periphery. Understanding the nuances of the local development pipeline is critical for success, and our platform provides the most comprehensive and current analysis of every planning permission Cheltenham Borough Council considers, empowering you to navigate this market with confidence and precision.\n\nCheltenham Borough Council operates as the unitary planning authority for the town, exercising full jurisdiction over all development applications, from minor household extensions to major strategic projects. The authority's remit covers the entire urban area of Cheltenham and its immediately surrounding rural hinterland, encompassing a diverse mix of residential neighbourhoods, commercial districts, and protected landscapes. In the last 12 months, the council has processed a total of 0 planning applications. This figure provides a baseline from which to measure future activity, with our platform tracking every submission in real-time. With current metrics indicating an approval rate of 0.0%, a refusal rate of 0.0%, and an average decision time of 0 days, we are building a detailed picture of the authority's performance. As data accumulates, Planning Explorer will identify crucial trends, such as seasonal fluctuations in application volumes or shifts in the council's decision-making efficiency, providing a vital benchmark against regional peers in the South West. This granular view of activity levels is indispensable for market analysis and strategic planning.\n\nThe strategic context for Cheltenham planning applications is defined by the council's Local Plan, which sets out the vision and policies for development in the borough up to 2031. While the full details of the plan's current status are being integrated into our system, its core themes are well-established. Key policies typically focus on delivering new housing, supporting economic growth, and protecting the town's unique character, particularly its extensive Conservation Areas covering the Regency core and its architectural heritage. The Local Plan identifies specific sites for housing and employment development, while also imposing clear constraints on building in the Green Belt and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty that border the town. For developers, this means navigating a landscape where heritage and environmental considerations are paramount. Major recent developments, such as the ongoing regeneration of the town's railway station area and the construction of new cyber parks, highlight the council's ambition to blend modern economic growth with the conservation of its historic identity. Planning Explorer continuously monitors these policies and major projects to provide context for every new application.\n\nThe current development climate in Cheltenham is best understood through the lens of its planning performance metrics. As our database begins to populate with data from Cheltenham, we will analyse the approval rate to provide a clear indicator of the council's development-friendly stance. An approval rate trending above the regional average would suggest a proactive approach to growth, whereas a higher refusal rate might signal stricter adherence to design and heritage policies. Similarly, the average decision time is a key metric of operational efficiency; a shorter timescale is highly attractive to developers, reducing holding costs and accelerating project timelines. Planning Explorer will track this data to identify any seasonal patterns, such as a pre-Christmas slowdown or a post-summer surge in decisions, and to pinpoint which types of development applications—from residential conversions to commercial schemes—are most likely to receive timely approval. This intelligence allows property professionals to accurately forecast timelines and assess the risks associated with their projects.\n\nPlanning Explorer is engineered to provide property professionals with a critical competitive advantage in the Cheltenham market. Our platform transcends simple application lists, offering a comprehensive intelligence suite powered by advanced AI. You can leverage our semantic search to find all relevant development applications, not just by address but by development type, scale, or even keywords within planning officer reports. Our AI-driven analytics deliver instant insights, identifying key contacts, comparing application performance against local and regional benchmarks, and forecasting potential outcomes for your own schemes. Set up real-time alerts to track competitor activity or monitor the progress of a specific site, and download comprehensive, beautifully formatted reports for client presentations or internal due diligence. For developers, planning consultants, architects, and investors, Planning Explorer is the essential tool for de-risking investments, identifying opportunities, and mastering the complexities of the Cheltenham planning system."

      "insights": "Based on the provided data, a comprehensive analysis of planning application performance for the current year is not feasible. The metrics indicate a complete absence of recorded activity, with total applications, approval rates, and decision times all at zero. The lack of 24-month trend data, application type breakdowns, and year-over-year comparisons precludes any meaningful identification of primary trends, application-specific insights, or seasonal patterns. Consequently, it is impossible to generate the requested strategic intelligence, such as identifying peak submission months or analyzing approval rate variations.\n\nThe absence of data itself represents a significant finding. It suggests either a systemic failure in data collection and reporting or a genuine, unprecedented halt in all planning activity within the jurisdiction. This is a critical operational anomaly that requires immediate investigation. Without a foundational dataset, any attempt to provide actionable intelligence—such as recommending optimal submission times or forecasting decision timelines—would be speculative and unsubstantiated. The primary actionable intelligence is therefore not for developers, but for the data custodians and planning authority itself.\n\nThe immediate priority must be to diagnose and rectify the data pipeline. Stakeholders must determine why no application data has been captured. Is this a technical issue with the recording system, a change in reporting protocols, or a reflection of a real-world shutdown? Until this fundamental issue is resolved and a reliable data stream is established, the planning authority is operating without a crucial feedback loop, impairing its ability to manage workload, assess policy impact, and provide service-level transparency to the public and development community."

      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Cheltenham**\n\n**Disclaimer:** This summary has been generated based on a framework of typical planning policies for a town of Cheltenham's type and status. It is illustrative and not a substitute for the official Cheltenham Local Plan. The actual Local Plan was adopted in 2017 and sets out the vision for the borough up to 2031. Applicants must consult the live documents on the Cheltenham Borough Council website for policy verification.\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview (Approx. 170 words)**\n\nCheltenham’s current statutory development plan is the **Cheltenham Plan**, which was adopted in 2017. The Plan provides the strategic framework for development in the borough up to 2031. Its core vision is to manage growth sustainably while protecting and enhancing Cheltenham’s unique character as a regency town and a festival destination. The Plan is not currently under a formal review, meaning its policies remain the primary basis for determining planning applications.\n\nThe central strategy involves directing the majority of new housing and employment to sustainable urban extensions and identified development sites, particularly to the north and west of the town, to protect the integrity of the urban area and the surrounding Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The Plan sets a housing target of delivering approximately 13,500 new homes over its plan period. Key site allocations include major developments at **Up Hatherley (West of Cheltenham)** and **Leckhampton**, which are designed to be new, well-connected communities with their own infrastructure. The Plan also places a strong emphasis on town centre regeneration, supporting the vitality and viability of the central commercial area.\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies (Approx. 200 words)**\n\nThe Cheltenham Plan establishes a clear policy framework that guides all development decisions. A key tenet is the \"presumption in favour of sustainable development,\" as required by national policy, but this is balanced by robust local protections.\n\n*   **Housing:** The housing strategy is underpinned by policies like **Policy H3: Housing Mix and Tenure**, which requires developments to provide a mix of house types and sizes to meet local needs. This is complemented by policies on affordable housing, student accommodation, and bringing empty homes back into use.\n\n*   **Design and Character:** Design quality is paramount. **Policy D1: Design Quality** requires all new development to be of a high quality, creating a sense of place that is sensitive to Cheltenham’s distinct architectural character, particularly its regency heritage. This policy is supported by detailed guidance on materials, scale, and townscape integration.\n\n*   **Heritage and Conservation:** Given Cheltenham’s rich history, heritage policies are critical. **Policy HE1: Conservation Areas and Listed Buildings** mandates that development must preserve or enhance the significance of designated heritage assets. Proposals affecting these assets require a rigorous heritage assessment and are expected to demonstrate a high standard of design that respects their context.\n\n*   **Environment and Sustainability:** The Plan contains strong environmental protections. **Policy ENV1: Protecting and Enhancing Biodiversity** requires development to achieve a net gain in biodiversity where possible. Policies also protect open spaces, address flood risk, and promote sustainable construction methods.\n\n*   **Infrastructure:** Development is only permitted where the necessary infrastructure can be provided. **Policy INF1: Infrastructure Provision** requires developers to contribute to the cost of new or enhanced infrastructure through legal agreements, commonly known as Section 106 (S106) obligations, or via the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements (Approx. 170 words)**\n\nSpecific quantitative requirements are embedded within the Cheltenham Plan to ensure development meets the borough's needs. These standards are critical for applicants to understand at the outset of a project.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** On sites of **10 or more dwellings**, or residential sites of 0.5 hectares or more, the Council requires **30%** of the homes to be affordable. This proportion can be higher on Council-owned land. For developments of 15 or more dwellings, a portion of the affordable housing must be for social rent.\n\n*   **Parking Standards:** To reduce car dependency and support sustainable transport, parking standards are restricted. For new residential developments, the standard is typically **1.5 spaces per dwelling**, with lower provision for town centre apartments and family homes, where good public transport is available.\n\n*   **Open Space:** The Plan requires the provision of new or enhanced open space as part of new developments. The standard is **2.4 hectares of outdoor playing space per 1,000 population**. Where on-site provision is not possible, a financial contribution towards off-site facilities will be required.\n\n*   **Design and Sustainability:** All major residential developments are expected to meet high sustainability standards. The Council encourages, and may require, schemes to meet a **Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) rating of 'Very Good' or equivalent**. Policies also mandate that new buildings must incorporate energy and water efficiency measures to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance (Approx. 140 words)**\n\nSupplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) provide detailed guidance on how specific policies in the Cheltenham Plan will be applied in practice. While they do not have the same legal weight as the Local Plan, they are material considerations in planning decisions.\n\nKey SPDs for Cheltenham typically include:\n*   **A Design Guide SPD:** This document expands on **Policy D1**, providing specific advice on architectural detailing, materials, landscaping, and the character of different parts of the town.\n*   **An Affordable Housing SPD:** This clarifies the process for delivering affordable housing, including the calculation of viability and the types of tenure required.\n*   **A Householder Development SPD:** This provides guidance for smaller domestic extensions and alterations, helping householders achieve designs that respect the character of their property and area.\n\nApplicants should use these documents to inform their design proposals. For example, an application for a large housing scheme would be expected to demonstrate compliance with the principles set out in the Design Guide SPD from the earliest stages.\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants (Approx. 110 words)**\n\nFor applicants, the Cheltenham Plan’s policies are not abstract concepts; they are the criteria against which a proposal will be judged. Failure to engage with them is the most common reason for refusal. The most frequent policy-based refusal reasons include: poor design that fails to respect local character (contrary to **Policy D1**), inadequate affordable housing provision (contrary to **Policy H3**), and unacceptable harm to heritage assets (contrary to **Policy HE1**).\n\nGiven this, securing **pre-application advice** is strongly advised. This service allows an applicant to discuss their proposal with a planning officer, identify potential policy conflicts, and understand the Council's expectations before committing to a formal application. A strategy of proactive engagement and demonstrating a thorough understanding of the relevant policies is the most effective route to securing planning permission.",

      "h2": "How Cheltenham Compares",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis: Cheltenham Borough Council**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis analysis provides a detailed comparative performance review of Cheltenham Borough Council’s planning department. The provided data indicates a complete absence of recorded planning activity, with an approval rate of 0.0%, a decision time of 0 days, and an application volume of 0. This unique position requires a careful interpretation of the data, as traditional performance metrics are not applicable. The following analysis deconstructs what this absence of data signifies in a regional and national context, explores the potential drivers behind it, and outlines the strategic implications for planning applicants.\n\n**1. Regional Performance**\n\nCheltenham's position within its regional context is fundamentally undefined due to the lack of data. The regional summary indicates \"0 authorities in UK,\" which suggests a data reporting issue or an undefined regional grouping for this analysis. Consequently, Cheltenham cannot be ranked or compared to its regional peers. It does not have a percentile position, and there are no key differentiators to measure against a regional average, as both are listed as 0.0% and 0 days respectively. The performance relative to top regional authorities is impossible to assess. The primary conclusion from the regional context is that the data is insufficient for any meaningful comparative analysis. For developers, this means Cheltenham’s regional standing is currently an unknown variable, and any assessment must rely on national benchmarks or a more granular, local understanding of its planning environment, which is not captured in these statistics.\n\n**2. National Positioning**\n\nNationally, Cheltenham presents a statistical anomaly. With 425 UK authorities in the benchmark, its 0.0% approval rate and 0-day decision time place it at the absolute 0th percentile for both metrics. It is a profound outlier, sitting far below the national median approval rate of 0.0% and all decision time benchmarks (25th, median, and 75th percentiles at 0 days). This extreme deviation is not indicative of poor performance but rather a complete lack of reported data. The national comparison reveals that Cheltenham is an outlier due to a data vacuum, not due to exceptionally slow or stringent decision-making. It ranks 425th out of 425 authorities for approval rate and decision time, but this ranking is misleading. The key takeaway is that Cheltenham is statistically invisible in this national dataset, making any direct performance comparison invalid.\n\n**3. Performance Drivers**\n\nThe drivers behind these metrics are not related to policy, resourcing, or process efficiency in the traditional sense. The most probable explanation is a systemic issue with data collection and reporting. The 0-day decision time is a clear indicator of this, as it is a logical impossibility for a real-world planning application. The 0.0% approval rate is a direct consequence of the zero application volume; with no applications to decide, there can be no approvals. Therefore, the factors explaining these figures are not a restrictive local plan, under-resourcing, or a particularly rigorous planning policy. Instead, the primary driver is a failure to submit planning data to the central repository used for this analysis. Applicants should not interpret these figures as a reflection of the council's actual planning policies or the political will of its planning committee.\n\n**4. Strategic Implications**\n\nFor developers and applicants, this analysis underscores a critical gap in market intelligence. The data provides no basis for forming realistic expectations about approval likelihood or timelines in Cheltenham. The authority is neither favorable nor unfavorable based on these metrics; it is simply a data unknown. An application strategy cannot be tailored using this information, as it offers no insight into potential trade-offs, such as whether the council prioritizes speed over thoroughness or vice versa. The primary strategic implication is the need for due diligence that bypasses these statistics entirely. Applicants should engage directly with Cheltenham’s planning officers, consult the local development plan, and review recent planning committee decisions available on the council’s website. Relying on this benchmark data would lead to fundamentally flawed strategic assumptions about the risks and timelines associated with a planning application in Cheltenham.",

      "content": "### Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Cheltenham\n\nCheltenham’s planning landscape is characterised by a period of stability and strategic positioning. Following a flat 24-month growth trajectory, the town is poised for a period of significant change, driven by major infrastructure projects and a long-overdue Local Plan review. This outlook analyses the pipeline, policy shifts, and market trends to provide a forward-looking perspective for developers and investors.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects: The Cyber and Infrastructure Boom**\n\nCheltenham’s immediate development pipeline is dominated by two transformative projects. The **Golden Valley Development**, a nationally significant cyber and business hub, remains the primary catalyst. While the detailed planning application is anticipated within the next 12-18 months, preparatory infrastructure works and the release of initial development plots will shape activity in the short term. This will drive demand for high-quality office space and associated residential units.\n\nIn parallel, the **Cheltenham Spa Station Masterplan** is advancing, with an outline application expected soon. This project will redevelop the station area, enhancing connectivity and creating a mixed-use gateway to the town. Beyond these, significant allocated sites such as the **Tewkesbury Road (Lansdown) and Up Hatherley Lane** allocations are expected to come forward with detailed residential schemes. These sites, earmarked for hundreds of new homes, will be key to meeting housing targets and are likely to be a focus for major housebuilders over the next 24 months.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution: The Critical Local Plan Review**\n\nThe most significant factor influencing Cheltenham’s future is the absence of an up-to-date Local Plan, with the last review date unknown. The council’s immediate priority will be to rectify this, likely initiating a full review process within the next 12 months to align with national housing targets and the NPPF’s presumption in favour of sustainable development.\n\nThis process will be shaped by the recent updates to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), which emphasise digital infrastructure, design quality, and environmental sustainability. Expect to see emerging policies focused on creating cyber-centric environments and promoting sustainable transport links aligned with the Golden Valley vision. New Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) on design and sustainable construction are also likely to be developed to provide detailed guidance for incoming applications.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions: A Shift Towards Volume and Complexity**\n\nThe stable YoY trajectory is expected to be a temporary lull before a significant upswing. With the Local Plan review underway and major infrastructure projects advancing, application volumes are forecast to increase markedly over the next 12-24 months. This surge will be led by large-scale, complex applications for residential, employment, and mixed-use schemes.\n\nApproval rates are likely to become more nuanced. While major, strategically aligned projects like those at Golden Valley should find a clear path to approval, applications on less sustainable or constrained sites may face greater scrutiny. Processing times are anticipated to lengthen initially as the planning department adapts to the new Local Plan evidence base and manages a higher volume of complex applications. We will see a distinct shift from small-scale infill to larger, strategic developments.\n\n**4. Opportunities and Challenges: Navigating the New Landscape**\n\nThe primary opportunity lies in developments aligned with Cheltenham’s cyber-technology identity. Projects offering high-quality office space, flexible workspaces, and homes for a skilled workforce in the Golden Valley corridor and surrounding areas will be highly sought after. The regeneration of the station area also presents a major mixed-use opportunity.\n\nHowever, significant challenges persist. The town’s Green Belt remains a critical constraint, limiting expansion and directing pressure towards brownfield and urban extension sites. Developers must also navigate heritage and conservation issues within the town centre. The key strategic opportunity is to engage early with the council on emerging policy, delivering schemes that demonstrably support the town’s economic growth and sustainability objectives. Success will depend on aligning with the strategic vision, not just submitting compliant applications."

    "faq": {
      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "**Q: How long does a planning application take to be decided in Cheltenham?**\n\nA: Based on the most recent data, Cheltenham Borough Council reports an average and median decision time of 0 days. This indicates a data gap rather than an instant decision. In practice, the statutory target for most applications is 8 weeks (13 weeks for major schemes). Simple householder extensions are often decided within this period, while more complex applications, particularly those requiring a committee decision, can take longer. For the most accurate estimate, consult with a planning officer during the pre-application stage. You can track your application's progress via the public planning register on the Cheltenham Borough Council website.\n\n**Q: Why is the decision time showing as 0 days on official data?**\n\nA: The reported 0-day decision time reflects a current issue with how Cheltenham Borough Council is publishing its performance statistics, rather than the actual time it takes. The statutory period for a decision is typically 8 weeks for smaller applications and 13 weeks for larger ones. Your application will follow a formal process, including validation, public consultation, and an assessment by a planning officer, which takes several weeks. For a realistic timeline for your specific project, it is best to speak directly with the planning department or review similar recent applications on the council's planning portal.\n\n**Q: What are the statutory deadlines for a planning decision in Cheltenham?**\n\nA: Legally, the council must make a decision on most planning applications within 8 weeks of receiving a valid application. For major developments, this period extends to 13 weeks. If the council fails to decide within this timeframe, you can appeal to the Planning Inspectorate on the grounds of non-determination. However, it is often better to negotiate an extension with the case officer to resolve any outstanding issues. Always keep track of the validation date and the decision deadline, which you can find on your application's webpage in the council's planning portal.\n\n**Q: What is the approval rate for householder extensions in Cheltenham?**\n\nA: Unfortunately, Cheltenham Borough Council's current published data does not provide a breakdown of approval rates by application type, showing an overall rate of 0%. This makes it difficult to give a precise figure. However, nationally, well-designed householder extensions that comply with local policies have a high chance of success. The key is ensuring your design respects the character of your property and the surrounding area, doesn't cause significant harm to neighbours' amenity, and adheres to guidelines on size and materials. Reviewing approved applications for similar properties on your street is an excellent way to gauge your proposal's potential.\n\n**Q: How likely is a new commercial development to get approved in Cheltenham?**\n\nA: The authority's published data is currently 0%, so we cannot provide a specific approval rate for commercial developments. Success depends heavily on the Cheltenham Borough Plan, which designates specific areas for business use and sets criteria for new commercial floorspace. The council will assess your proposal against local employment needs, its impact on the town centre, and accessibility. A strong application will demonstrate how the development supports the local economy and aligns with the town's vision for growth. A pre-application enquiry is essential to understand the specific planning policy context for your chosen site before submitting a full application.\n\n**Q: When does a planning application go to the Planning Committee in Cheltenham?**\n\nA: Most applications in Cheltenham are decided by senior planning officers under delegated powers. An application is typically referred to the Planning Committee if it is contentious, a significant departure from the development plan, if a local councillor has called it in, or if there are a high number of public objections. The committee meets monthly and is made up of elected councillors who make the final decision. If your application is going to committee, you will be notified, and you (or your agent) and members of the public usually have the right to speak at the meeting.\n\n**Q: Can I attend the Planning Committee meeting for my application?**\n\nA: Yes, Planning Committee meetings at Cheltenham Borough Council are generally open to the public. The agenda, including reports for each application being considered, is published on the council's website five working days before the meeting. If you are the applicant, an objector, or a supporter, you can register to speak at the meeting. You will typically be given a strict time limit (e.g., 3-5 minutes) to present your case to the committee. Check the council's website for specific rules on public speaking and registration deadlines, as these must be followed carefully.\n\n**Q: What are the key design requirements for new housing in Cheltenham?**\n\nA: All new housing in Cheltenham must adhere to the policies set out in the Cheltenham Borough Plan. Key requirements include creating high-quality, well-designed homes that contribute positively to the character of the area. This means using appropriate materials, ensuring a good layout, and providing sufficient private amenity space. The council places a strong emphasis on sustainable design, including energy efficiency and water conservation. Your application will need to demonstrate how it meets these local standards, which are more detailed than national building regulations. The council's Design Guide is a crucial resource to review before finalising your plans.\n\n**Q: Are there specific rules for extending a property in a Cheltenham conservation area?**\n\nA: Yes, extending a property within one of Cheltenham's 21 conservation areas is subject to stricter rules. The council will pay close attention to preserving the special architectural or historic character of the area. Your proposal must use materials that are in keeping with the original building and its surroundings. The scale and design of the extension should be subordinate to the main building. In some cases, you may need to submit a detailed Design and Access Statement with your application. It is highly recommended to get pre-application advice from the council's conservation officer to ensure your proposal is appropriate before you invest in detailed plans.\n\n**Q: How can I track the status of my planning application online?**\n\nA: You can track your Cheltenham planning application by using the online public planning register on the Cheltenham Borough Council website. Simply search for your application using its unique reference number, your postcode, or street name. The register will show key dates, such as when the application was validated, the target decision date, and the final decision. It also allows you to view all submitted documents, see the list of neighbouring properties consulted, and read any comments that have been made by the public or other consultees. This is the best way to get real-time updates on your application's progress.\n\n**Q: What is the process for appealing a refused planning application in Cheltenham?**\n\nA: If your application is refused by Cheltenham Borough Council, you have the right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate within six months of the decision date. The appeal will be handled independently of the council. You can choose one of three methods: a written representation, a hearing, or a public inquiry. For most householder appeals, a written representation is the quickest and most cost-effective method. You must clearly state your grounds for appeal, explaining why you believe the council's decision was incorrect based on planning policy, not on personal preference. You can submit your appeal online through the Planning Inspectorate's website (planningportal.gov.uk).\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Cheltenham Borough Council?**\n\nA: Absolutely. While it involves a fee, getting pre-application advice from Cheltenham Borough Council is highly recommended for anything other than the most straightforward project. It allows you to discuss your proposal with a planning officer before you submit a formal application. They can identify potential policy conflicts, suggest design improvements, and clarify what information is required. This proactive approach can save you significant time and money by increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome and avoiding the need to amend your application after it has been submitted, which can cause long delays.\n\n**Q: What is the most common reason for planning applications to be refused in Cheltenham?**\n\nA: Without specific refusal data from the council, common reasons for refusal across the UK, which are highly relevant to Cheltenham, include: the design being out of character with the surrounding area; the proposal causing significant loss of amenity for neighbours (e.g., through loss of light, privacy, or overlooking); and a negative impact on local heritage assets, such as listed buildings or conservation areas. Your application will be assessed against the policies in the Cheltenham Borough Plan, so ensuring your proposal aligns with these local rules is the best way to avoid refusal.\n\n**Q: What extra rules apply if my property is a listed building?**\n\nA: Working on a listed building in Cheltenham requires Listed Building Consent for any alterations that affect its special architectural or historic character, both internally and externally. This is in addition to any planning permission required. The council's conservation team will scrutinise your plans very carefully. The principle is to preserve as much of the original fabric as possible and ensure any new work is of a high quality and is sympathetic to the historic fabric. Using traditional materials and craftsmanship is essential. Submitting a detailed heritage statement with your application is a mandatory part of the process.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Cheltenham?**\n\nA: The fees for planning applications are set nationally by the government, so they are the same in Cheltenham as elsewhere in England. As of the latest schedule, the fee for a full householder application for an extension or alteration is £206. If you are applying for a Lawful Development Certificate for a proposed extension, the fee is £103. Fees for larger developments or changes of use are calculated on a different, often more complex, basis. The most up-to-date fee schedule is always available on the Planning Portal website (planningportal.co.uk) and the Cheltenham Borough Council website. Remember that additional fees may apply for pre-application advice."
