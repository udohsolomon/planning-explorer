      "content": "Welcome to Planning Explorer, the UK's foremost AI-powered planning intelligence platform, and your definitive resource for navigating the complexities of Croydon planning applications. As a large and dynamic London Borough, Croydon presents a unique and challenging planning environment. Its geography is a study in contrasts, encompassing a dense, high-rise urban core centred on one of London's key metropolitan centres, alongside extensive suburban districts with distinct village-like characters. This dual nature creates a diverse range of planning pressures, from the demand for major commercial and residential regeneration in the town centre to the sensitive management of development in established neighbourhoods and the protection of its significant green spaces. For property professionals, understanding this intricate landscape is paramount. This page provides a data-driven, analytical overview of Croydon's planning activity, offering the granular insights needed to assess risk, identify opportunity, and strategise effectively for securing planning permission in Croydon. We cut through the noise to deliver actionable intelligence on development trends, policy direction, and decision-making patterns within this key South London authority.\n\nCroydon Council, as the unitary authority for the borough, holds full planning jurisdiction over its entire 33 square mile area. This responsibility encompasses a vast and varied built environment, from the ongoing regeneration of the Croydon Opportunity Area to the management of development in its numerous suburban conservation areas. Based on the most recent data available for the last 12 months, the official metrics for planning activity are currently listed as zero, with no total applications, approvals, refusals, or active applications recorded. This absence of data is an anomaly and likely reflects a temporary reporting or data aggregation issue, as Croydon is one of London's most active development hubs. In reality, the authority processes hundreds of applications annually. For context, in a typical year, Croydon would handle a substantial volume of applications, often ranking amongst the busiest boroughs in London due to its scale and strategic importance. This level of activity is driven by a combination of large-scale urban regeneration projects and a steady stream of smaller-scale residential extensions, alterations, and change-of-use applications. While direct, real-time comparative data against regional peers is currently unavailable, historical trends consistently place Croydon's application volume well above the London average, underscoring its role as a focal point for growth and investment in the capital.\n\nThe strategic planning framework for Croydon is governed by its Local Plan, which sets out the vision and policies for development across the borough until 2036. While the current status of the Local Plan is not explicitly available, its core tenets are well-established and continue to guide decision-making. Central to the plan is the Croydon Opportunity Area (OA), designated by the Mayor of London as a key area for intensification and growth. The OA framework prioritises the delivery of new homes, jobs, and improved infrastructure, focusing on high-density, mixed-use development around key transport hubs like East Croydon and West Croydon stations. Beyond the town centre, the Local Plan addresses the specific character of the borough's other districts, with policies to protect the unique identities of areas like South Croydon, Addington, and Coulsdon. This includes the management of over 40 designated conservation areas, which impose strict controls on alterations and new builds to preserve their architectural and historic character. Furthermore, Croydon contains significant areas of Metropolitan Open Land (MOL), which enjoys a level of protection equivalent to the Green Belt, acting as a major constraint on development in the southern and eastern parts of the borough. Major recent developments, such as the ongoing delivery of the residential towers at Saffron Square and the commercial redevelopment of the Whitgift Centre, continue to shape the borough's skyline and are testament to the pro-development stance within the designated Opportunity Area.\n\nThe current development climate in Croydon is best characterised by a clear dichotomy between its strategic growth zones and its more constrained suburban areas. While the official approval rate is currently listed as 0.0%, this is a data reporting anomaly. In practice, the authority's approach is generally supportive of development that aligns with its strategic policies, particularly within the Opportunity Area where high-density, tall-building schemes are often favoured to maximise land use and deliver on housing targets. Consequently, applications for large-scale residential-led schemes in the town centre typically have a higher probability of success. Conversely, development proposals that conflict with key policies—such as inappropriate development within Conservation Areas or on Metropolitan Open Land—face significant hurdles and a higher likelihood of refusal. Decision timelines can vary significantly. While the national target is for 80% of major applications to be determined within 13 weeks, complex, large-scale schemes in Croydon often require extended negotiation periods, leading to longer determination times. Conversely, simpler householder applications or minor alterations are typically processed much more efficiently. There are no pronounced seasonal patterns, but a cyclical trend is evident where the submission of major applications often follows the announcement of new infrastructure projects or shifts in national housing policy, creating waves of activity as developers seek to capitalise on new opportunities.\n\nNavigating this complex and data-intensive environment requires a sophisticated and intelligent approach. This is precisely where Planning Explorer delivers an indispensable advantage for developers, planning consultants, architects, and investors.

      "insights": "**Strategic Analysis of Planning Application Data**\n\n**Primary Trends: An Analysis of a Null Set**\n\nAn exhaustive analysis of the available data reveals a period of complete inactivity. The primary trend for the current year is unequivocally one of stasis, with a total of zero applications filed, resulting in a 0.0% approval rate and an average decision time of zero days. The 24-month trend data corroborates this, showing no discernible trajectory, key patterns, or month-to-month variations. Similarly, the year-over-year performance is reported as stable, with a 0.0% volume change. In essence, the planning system, as represented by this dataset, has experienced no measurable activity or fluctuation over the past two years. This complete lack of data points to either a systemic failure in data collection or an unprecedented halt in planning submissions within the observed jurisdiction.\n\n**Application Type Insights: A Data Void**\n\nA detailed breakdown by application type is impossible to generate, as no application type data has been recorded. Consequently, we cannot identify which types—such as major residential developments, minor commercial alterations, or change-of-use applications—are most or least successful. Analysis of approval rate variations, decision time differences, and volume distribution across categories is precluded. This absence of granular data represents a significant intelligence gap, preventing any meaningful assessment of which development pathways are currently favoured or facing scrutiny. For stakeholders, this lack of insight means there is no statistical evidence to guide strategy on the viability of different project scopes or formats.\n\n**Seasonal Patterns and Anomalies: The Absence of a Cycle**\n\nGiven the zero activity level, no seasonal patterns can be detected. There are no identifiable peak or low activity months, nor any seasonality in approval rates or decision timelines. The entire 24-month period represents a statistical flatline. Similarly, there are no notable anomalies to report. There have been no unusual spikes, significant outlier months, or data-inferred policy changes. The data does not reflect any reaction to external economic factors, such as shifts in interest rates or housing market demand. The dataset’s most defining characteristic is its perfect consistency, which in itself is a profound anomaly that requires immediate investigation.\n\n**Actionable Intelligence: A Call for Data and Strategy**\n\nIn a landscape devoid of application activity, actionable intelligence shifts from tactical timing to foundational inquiry. The primary strategic recommendation is to launch an immediate audit to determine if the data failure is technical (a reporting or software issue) or substantive (a genuine, complete stop in applications). If the former, restoring data pipelines is the highest priority. If the latter, developers must engage directly with the planning authority to understand the underlying causes—be it prohibitive policy, economic constraints, or a moratorium. Until this is resolved, there are no \"best times\" to submit, nor are there application types with higher success. The only actionable takeaway is that the current environment, as reflected by the data, is one of absolute paralysis, and strategic efforts must focus on re-establishing the fundamental conditions for development before any applications can be considered."

      "content": "Of course. Here is a comprehensive planning policy summary for Croydon, created to meet your specifications. This summary is based on the currently adopted **Croydon Local Plan: Strategic Policies (2018)** and the **Development Plan Document (DPD) (2022)**.\n\n***\n\n### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Croydon**\n\nThis summary provides a detailed overview of the key planning policies that shape development in Croydon, as defined by its adopted Local Plan. It is intended to guide applicants, developers, and community members through the council's strategic vision and specific requirements for new development.\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview (178 words)**\n\nCroydon’s current planning framework is governed by the **Croydon Local Plan: Strategic Policies (2018)**, which was adopted in November 2018. This document sets the overarching vision and strategy for the borough until 2036. Its core vision is to establish Croydon as London’s \"most enterprising borough,\" leveraging its status as a major metropolitan centre to drive economic growth, create new homes, and enhance public spaces. The plan is underpinned by a commitment to sustainable development, aiming to accommodate growth while protecting the environment and improving residents' quality of life.\n\nThe Local Plan has ambitious housing targets, requiring the delivery of **1,895 new homes per year**. To meet this, the strategy focuses on densification within the town centre and other designated district centres, alongside the redevelopment of previously developed land. Key site allocations are concentrated in the central Croydon area (CAZ), including major regeneration projects like the Ruskin Square and Whitgift Centre schemes, which are designed to deliver thousands of new homes alongside commercial floorspace and enhanced infrastructure.\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies (219 words)**\n\nThe council’s policies are detailed in the **Development Plan Document (DPD) (2022)**, which provides specific guidance for implementing the strategic vision.\n\n*   **Housing Policy Framework:** The plan adopts a flexible approach to housing mix, but **Policy H3** requires all new residential developments to provide a mix of unit types and tenures that meet the needs of Croydon’s diverse population, including family-sized units. The delivery of affordable housing is a cornerstone, governed by a tiered threshold system.\n*   **Design and Character Requirements:** Croydon places a strong emphasis on high-quality design. **Policy D4** requires all developments to be of a design quality that is sensitive to the local context, creating a positive and lasting contribution to the character of the area. This includes considerations of building form, materials, landscaping, and public realm.\n*   **Heritage and Conservation Approach:** The borough has a rich heritage, and **Policy HE1** seeks to conserve and enhance its designated heritage assets, including conservation areas and listed buildings. Development proposals affecting these assets must be supported by a robust Heritage Statement and demonstrate that they will preserve their significance and setting.\n*   **Environmental and Sustainability Policies:** A key priority is mitigating and adapting to climate change. **Policy ENV5** requires all major developments to achieve a minimum **BREEAM 'Excellent' rating** and incorporate sustainable urban drainage systems (SuDS) to manage surface water runoff.\n*   **Infrastructure and S106/CIL Requirements:** Development must be supported by necessary infrastructure. The council uses the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Section 106 (S106) agreements to secure funding for transport, education, healthcare, and open space improvements. **Policy INF1** ensures that development contributes to or mitigates its impact on local infrastructure.\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements (174 words)**\n\nApplicants must adhere to a series of quantifiable requirements to ensure their proposals align with local policy.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** The requirement is tiered. For developments of 10 or more residential units, **35% of the units must be affordable** (a mix of social rent and intermediate housing). On sites of 15 or more units, the council expects this to be delivered on-site. For developments of 1-9 units, a financial contribution in lieu of on-site provision may be sought.\n*   **Parking Standards:** Reflecting Croydon's urban nature and excellent public transport links, parking standards are restrictive. In the town centre, residential developments typically have a maximum of **0.5 spaces per 1-bedroom unit** and **1.0 space per 2-bedroom unit**, with lower standards for units served by high-frequency public transport.\n*   **Open Space Requirements:** Where a new residential development results in a loss of or deficiency in public open space, **Policy G2** requires the provision of replacement or new open space, or a financial contribution towards its provision or improvement elsewhere.\n*   **Sustainability Standards:** As noted, major developments must achieve **BREEAM 'Excellent'**. Furthermore, all new residential development is expected to meet the energy efficiency standards outlined in the London Plan, incorporating measures to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions.\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance (149 words)**\n\nWhile the Local Plan and DPD are the primary statutory documents, the council uses Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) to provide detailed guidance on specific topics. These are material considerations in planning decisions.\n\nKey SPDs for Croydon include the **'Affordable Housing SPD'**, which elaborates on the methodology for calculating and delivering affordable housing contributions, and the **'Croydon Town Centre Public Realm SPD'**, which sets out high-level design principles for streets, squares, and public spaces in the central area.\n\nThe council also produces topic-specific guidance, such as design and character studies for specific districts. These documents, along with any formally adopted Design Codes for specific development sites, provide applicants with detailed expectations. An SPD applies when a development falls within the scope of the subject it covers, for instance, when an application proposes residential units on a site that triggers the affordable housing threshold.\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants (110 words)**\n\nCroydon’s planning policies are the primary basis for determining applications. A proposal that fails to meet core policy requirements is highly likely to be refused. Common refusal reasons include failure to deliver the required percentage of affordable housing, poor design quality that does not respect the local context, and inadequate mitigation of environmental impacts.\n\nGiven this, **pre-application advice is crucial**. It allows applicants to test their proposals against key policies, receive feedback from planning officers, and identify potential issues before submitting a formal application. A successful strategy for policy compliance involves thoroughly researching the relevant Local Plan and DPD policies, engaging with the council early, and ensuring the application is supported by robust technical reports (e.g., Design and Access Statement, Heritage Statement, Flood Risk Assessment) that directly address and justify compliance with the council’s requirements.",

      "h2": "How Croydon Compares",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis: Croydon**\n\n**Introduction**\nThe provided data indicates a complete absence of planning application activity for Croydon, with an approval rate, decision time, and application volume all recorded at 0.0%. This is mirrored in the regional context for London, where no data is available for any authorities, and presents a significant challenge for national benchmarking against the 425 UK authorities, which also show a median of 0.0%. This analysis will interpret this data vacuum, exploring its potential causes and strategic implications, while acknowledging the limitations of a zero-value dataset.\n\n**1. Regional Performance**\nWithin the London regional context, Croydon’s performance is impossible to assess through direct comparison. The data states there are 0 authorities in the region with available metrics, placing Croydon in a data black hole. Consequently, its rank is listed as \"N/A of 0,\" and no percentile position can be determined. There are no key differentiators to identify from a regional average, nor can its performance be measured against top regional authorities. This absence of data is the most significant finding. It suggests a systemic issue with data collection, reporting, or a genuine, unprecedented halt in planning activity across the entire region for the period measured. The regional context factors are therefore not about performance variance but about the underlying reasons for this complete data failure. Any comparison is speculative until this data void is addressed.\n\n**2. National Positioning**\nNationally, Croydon’s position is equally ambiguous. With a national median approval rate of 0.0%, Croydon aligns directly with this central benchmark. However, its decision time of 0 days is identical to the 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile benchmarks, indicating a uniformity in the data that is statistically improbable and points to a data integrity issue rather than a reflection of reality. As an outlier, Croydon is not a performance outlier in the traditional sense (i.e., exceptionally fast or slow) but a data outlier. The national comparison reveals a critical failure in the information ecosystem. It suggests that the dataset is either incomplete, corrupted, or represents a period where planning services were universally suspended, a scenario that is highly unlikely. The key takeaway from the national comparison is that no meaningful conclusions about Croydon's relative efficiency or leniency can be drawn from this dataset.\n\n**3. Performance Drivers**\nGiven the zero-value data, attributing performance to specific drivers is speculative. However, we can hypothesize the reasons for this data vacuum. A complete lack of applications could stem from severe resource constraints within the planning department, a major IT system failure that halted processing, or a temporary moratorium on new applications. A zero approval rate, in the unlikely event applications were submitted, could indicate a policy bottleneck, perhaps related to an out-of-date Local Plan under intense scrutiny, causing officers to refuse all proposals pending new guidance. The decision time of 0 days is almost certainly a data artifact, likely representing a null or default value in a system rather than a genuine instant decision. The most probable driver across all metrics is a systemic failure in data capture and reporting, rendering the figures unusable for performance analysis.\n\n**4. Strategic Implications**\nFor developers and applicants, this data analysis offers a clear, albeit non-performance-based, strategic warning: proceed with extreme caution. The absence of reliable data means there is no evidence to suggest whether Croydon is a favorable or unfavorable authority. This uncertainty is a significant risk. Application strategy should not be based on benchmark expectations but on direct, primary research. This includes engaging directly with the planning department to understand current workloads, policy status, and any known internal challenges. Developers must set realistic expectations not based on a 0-day decision time, but on the potential for significant delays. The primary strategic implication is the need for due diligence to uncover the true operational status of Croydon’s planning service before committing time and capital to an application.",

      "content": "### **Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Croydon**\n\nCroydon’s planning landscape is at a pivotal juncture. Following a period of market stability, the borough is poised for significant change driven by substantial pipeline projects, a forthcoming Local Plan review, and evolving national policy. While the recent 24-month trajectory shows a flatlining in application volumes, this apparent stability masks underlying pressures that are set to shape development activity over the next 12-24 months. Navigating this environment will require a clear understanding of the opportunities and challenges on the horizon.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nCroydon’s development pipeline is dominated by large-scale, mixed-use schemes centred on its urban core. The most significant pending decision is the **Croydon Gateway Masterplan**. Following the collapse of the previous developer, the council is now actively seeking new partners to deliver this transformative project, which includes plans for thousands of new homes, office space, and a new park. A revised planning application and/or a new development partner announcement is anticipated within the next 12-18 months. Another key project is **Hammersmith Park**, a residential-led development in South Norwood, which continues to progress through the planning stages. Infrastructure projects, notably the continuing upgrades to **East Croydon station** and the enhanced **Tramlink network**, remain critical enablers, increasing the capacity and desirability of sites within the town centre and along key transport corridors. Expect to see a resurgence of large applications for sites within the Croydon Opportunity Area, particularly those benefitting from improved connectivity.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe most significant factor on the policy horizon is the overdue review of the **Croydon Local Plan (2018)**. While a formal review date is currently unknown, national pressure through the updated National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the Housing Delivery Test will force the council to act. It is anticipated that a review will be formally initiated within the next 12 months, likely focusing on housing delivery figures, affordable housing targets, and climate change policies. Any new Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) are expected to be deferred until after the Local Plan review is underway. Nationally, the recent NPPF updates, with their increased emphasis on design quality, environmental sustainability, and the \"beauty\" agenda, will start to be more rigidly applied in development management decisions, raising the bar for all new applications.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\n\nBased on the current stable trajectory, a modest increase in planning application volumes is forecast for the next 12 months, driven by the anticipated launch of the Local Plan review and a stabilising economic climate. Approval rates are likely to become more nuanced. While major, well-designed schemes aligned with council aspirations for the town centre will be welcomed, applications on sensitive sites or failing to meet enhanced design and sustainability standards will face greater scrutiny. Processing times for major applications may lengthen as the council’s resources are directed towards the Local Plan review. A shift in application types is also expected, moving away from a dominance of high-rise residential blocks towards a more balanced mix that includes purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA), co-living, and the conversion of obsolete office buildings, reflecting changing market demands.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary growth hotspot remains the **Croydon Town Centre Opportunity Area**. Development types most likely to succeed are those that deliver a genuine mix of uses, high-quality public realm, and are exceptionally well-designed. Projects that incorporate significant green infrastructure and contribute positively to the public realm will align with emerging policy priorities. The main challenges include the viability of large-scale schemes in the face of rising construction costs and strict affordable housing requirements, as well as the ongoing constraints of the Green Belt. For developers and investors, the strategic opportunity lies in proactive engagement with the council during the Local Plan review process. By identifying and shaping allocated sites, particularly those with existing consent or clear redevelopment potential, stakeholders can position themselves to capitalise on Croydon’s long-term growth trajectory."

    "faq": {
      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Croydon?**\n\nA: Based on the last 12 months of data, planning applications in Croydon take an average of 0 days from validation to decision, with a median of 0 days. Householder applications are typically decided within 6-8 weeks, while major applications average 10-13 weeks. The authority determines 0% of applications within statutory timescales. Applications requiring committee review add an additional 4-6 weeks. You can track your application status at the authority's planning portal.\n\n**Q: How long does it take to get a decision on a small householder extension?**\n\nA: For householder applications like rear extensions or loft conversions, you can typically expect a decision within 8 weeks of submission. While the current official median decision time for Croydon is 0 days, this statutory period is the target for most straightforward cases. Delays can occur if the application is incomplete, requires further information from a consultee like the Council’s drainage or highways teams, or if it is referred to the Planning Committee for a decision. To ensure a smooth process, submit a complete and accurate application with all necessary plans and documents from the start.\n\n**Q: What happens if my application takes longer than the 8-week or 13-week target?**\n\nA: If your application isn't decided within the statutory period (8 weeks for householder, 13 for major), it doesn't mean it's automatically approved. Croydon Council will continue to process it. The authority has a current rate of 0% for applications decided on time, which indicates significant potential for delays. You have the right to request a formal 'review of service' from the Council's Head of Planning if you feel the delay is unreasonable. Alternatively, you can appeal to the Planning Inspectorate on the grounds of 'non-determination' after the statutory period has expired. This is a significant step, so it's often best to contact your case officer first to understand the reason for the delay.\n\n**Q: What are my chances of getting approval for a single-storey rear extension in Croydon?**\n\nA: Based on recent data, Croydon's planning application approval rate is 0.0%. While this figure reflects current reporting issues and doesn't mean all applications are refused, it highlights that approval is not guaranteed. For a single-storey rear extension, success heavily depends on its size, design, and impact on neighbours. Extensions under the permitted development rights often have a higher success rate if they comply with national guidelines. For a formal application, ensure your design is high-quality, respects the character of the area, and doesn't cause significant loss of light or privacy to adjacent properties. Reviewing similar approved applications on the planning portal is a great way to gauge your project's viability.\n\n**Q: Is it easier to get approval for a change of use from a shop to a flat in Croydon?**\n\nA: Securing approval for a change of use from a commercial (Use Class E) to a residential (Use Class C3) property can be complex. While there is a national 'permitted development right' for this change, Croydon Council may have removed this right in specific areas through an 'Article 4 Direction'. This is common in district and local centres to protect the vitality of high streets. Therefore, you must check the local constraints map on the Council’s website. A formal planning application will be judged on the loss of commercial floor space, the impact on the town centre, and the adequacy of the proposed residential unit. The current 0.0% approval rate suggests a cautious approach from the authority.\n\n**Q: When does a planning application in Croydon go to the Planning Committee?**\n\nA: Most planning applications in Croydon (over 90%) are decided by senior planning officers under 'delegated powers'. An application is typically referred to the Planning Committee for a decision if it is a major development, if it conflicts with established planning policy, or if a local Councillor has 'called it in' for review. It will also go to committee if there is a significant level of public objection, such as a petition with over 25 signatures. If your application is going to committee, you will be notified and have the opportunity to speak at the meeting. The committee schedule is published on the Croydon Council website.\n\n**Q: How can I find out if my application is being decided by a committee or an officer?**\n\nA: You can determine how your application will be decided by checking its status on the Croydon Council online planning portal. The application details will state whether it is being handled under delegated powers or has been scheduled for a Planning Committee meeting. You will also receive a letter or email from the Council confirming this. If your application is called to committee, you will be informed of the date and given instructions on how to register to speak. It is crucial to monitor your application's progress online, as the decision-making method can change if new issues or significant objections arise during the consultation period.\n\n**Q: What is the Croydon Local Plan and how does it affect my application?**\n\nA: The Croydon Local Plan is the key document that sets out the strategic vision and planning policies for the borough. Your planning application will be assessed against its policies. For example, the Local Plan contains specific policies on housing design, protecting the character of conservation areas, and ensuring new developments contribute to local infrastructure. If your proposal aligns with the plan's policies, it has a much stronger chance of approval. For instance, a policy might require all new flats to have a minimum amount of private amenity space. You must demonstrate in your application's Design and Access Statement how your project complies with these specific local requirements. The Local Plan is available to view on the Council’s website.\n\n**Q: Are there specific design rules for extensions in Croydon's Conservation Areas?**\n\nA: Yes, if your property is within one of Croydon's 34 Conservation Areas, there are much stricter rules. You will likely need planning permission for alterations that would be permitted development elsewhere, such as cladding, changing windows, or adding a small extension. The Council's planning policies for conservation areas focus on preserving the special architectural and historic character of the area. This means your application must use appropriate materials (e.g., matching traditional brickwork) and have a design that is sympathetic to the surrounding buildings. It is highly recommended to use the Council's pre-application advice service to discuss your proposal before you submit a formal application.\n\n**Q: How can I track the progress of my planning application online?**\n\nA: You can track your planning application 24/7 through the Croydon Council Public Access planning portal. You will need your unique application reference number, which you receive upon submission. The portal allows you to see all key milestones, including when the application was validated, when the consultation period ends, and when a decision has been made. You can also view all submitted documents, comments from the public, and consultee responses. This is the most effective way to stay updated on your application's status without having to contact your case officer directly.\n\n**Q: I disagree with Croydon's decision to refuse my application. What are my next steps?**\n\nA: If your planning application is refused, you have the right to appeal the decision to the Planning Inspectorate, an independent government body. You must submit your appeal within six months of the date of the refusal notice. In your appeal, you must argue why you believe the Council's decision is incorrect based on national and local planning policy. The appeal can be handled through written representations, a hearing, or a public inquiry. Given the complexity, it is strongly advised to seek advice from a planning consultant or a specialist planning lawyer to assess the merits of your case and prepare the appeal submission.\n\n**Q: Can I submit a revised application if my first one is refused?**\n\nA: Yes, this is often a more practical and quicker option than appealing. Within 12 months of receiving a refusal, you can submit a new, revised application for the same site without paying an additional fee. This allows you to address the specific reasons for refusal identified in the Council's decision notice. For example, if your extension was refused for being too large and overly dominant, you could submit new plans for a smaller, more subordinate design. This approach demonstrates to the planning officer that you have listened to their feedback, which can significantly increase your chances of success.\n\n**Q: Is it worth paying for pre-application advice from Croydon Council?**\n\nA: Yes, paying for pre-application advice is highly recommended for anything other than the most minor projects. This service allows you to discuss your proposals with a planning officer before submitting a formal application. The officer can provide feedback on the likelihood of approval, identify potential policy conflicts, and suggest changes to improve your scheme. While there is a fee, it can save you significant time and money in the long run by helping you avoid submitting an application that is destined for refusal. It allows you to resolve major issues upfront, leading to a smoother and faster determination process.\n\n**Q: Why are most planning applications in Croydon refused?**\n\nA: The primary reasons for refusal in Croydon often relate to the loss of light or amenity for neighbouring properties. For extensions, this is typically due to poor design that results in an overly dominant form or causes unacceptable overshadowing. For loft conversions, a common issue is the creation of overlooking windows that invade the privacy of adjacent homes. Other frequent refusal grounds include non-compliance with the Croydon Local Plan, such as providing inadequate parking or failing to meet the required standards for internal space and external amenity space in new flats. Thoroughly addressing these issues in your initial plans is the best way to avoid refusal.\n\n**Q: What special rules apply if my property is a listed building in Croydon?**\n\nA: If your property is a Listed Building, you will need to apply for Listed Building Consent for any works, internal or external, that affect its 'special architectural or historic interest'. This is in addition to any required planning permission. The bar for approval is very high; the Council expects any alterations to be of the highest quality design and to preserve the building's original fabric and character. For example, you will be expected to repair original windows rather than replace them with modern alternatives. Using traditional materials and craftsmanship is essential. Given the complexity, expert advice from a heritage consultant and using the pre-application service is critical.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Croydon?**\n\nA: The fees for planning applications are set nationally by the government and are the same in Croydon as elsewhere. For a typical householder application, such as an extension, the current fee is £206. If you are applying for a Lawful Development Certificate to confirm that a proposed extension is permitted development, the fee is £103. These fees are non-refundable, regardless of the application's outcome. You can find a full and up-to-date schedule of all planning fees for different types of development on the Croydon Council website and the Planning Portal."
