      "content": "Welcome to the definitive resource for **Ealing planning applications**, powered by Planning Explorer, the UK's leading AI-driven planning intelligence platform. This page provides an unparalleled, data-rich analysis of the development landscape within the London Borough of Ealing, a unitary authority renowned for its unique blend of dense urban centres and tranquil suburban spaces. As one of London's largest boroughs by population, Ealing faces a complex set of planning pressures, from the need for significant residential growth and town centre regeneration to the imperative of preserving its cherished character, extensive green spaces, and distinct village identities. Whether you are a developer, architect, investor, or planning consultant, understanding the nuances of Ealing's planning system is critical. Our platform synthesises and analyses every application, providing the actionable intelligence needed to navigate this dynamic environment with confidence and precision.\n\n**Planning Jurisdiction & Activity**\n\nThe London Borough of Ealing serves as the sole Local Planning Authority (LPA) for its entire geographic area, encompassing the major town centres of Ealing, Acton, Southall, and Hanwell, alongside numerous smaller neighbourhoods and villages. Its planning scope is comprehensive, covering everything from large-scale regeneration schemes and high-rise residential developments to minor household alterations and changes of use. In the last 12 months, the authority has received **0 planning applications**. This figure represents the total volume of formal submissions seeking planning permission. Consequently, the key performance indicators for this period are as follows: the approval rate stands at **0.0%**, the refusal rate is **0.0%**, and the average decision time is recorded as **0 days**. The current number of active applications awaiting a decision is **0**. This data provides a baseline for tracking future activity and allows for a direct, quantitative comparison with neighbouring west London boroughs such as Hounslow and Brent, enabling a clear understanding of Ealing's relative position within the regional development market.\n\n**Local Planning Landscape**\n\nThe strategic framework for development in Ealing is guided by its adopted Local Plan, which sets out the vision and policies for managing growth and change across the borough. While specific details of the Local Plan's current status are not available, such documents typically identify key strategic sites for development, outline housing and employment targets, and establish policies to protect the borough's character. Key development areas are generally concentrated around the town centres, which are designated for intensification to support sustainable transport links and economic vitality. The planning landscape is heavily influenced by significant constraints, including the Metropolitan Open Land that surrounds much of the borough, numerous Conservation Areas (such as those in Ealing, Hanwell, and Pitshanger), and a wealth of listed buildings. Furthermore, the Crossrail Elizabeth Line, with stations at Ealing Broadway, West Ealing, Hanwell, and Southall, continues to be a transformative factor, driving development interest and shaping policy around station-centric growth. Balancing the demand for new homes and commercial spaces with the protection of these valuable assets remains the central challenge for planners in Ealing.\n\n**Current Development Climate**\n\nThe current development climate in Ealing can be interpreted through the lens of its recent planning metrics. With an approval rate of **0.0%** and a refusal rate of **0.0%** over the last year, the data reflects a period of no application activity rather than a trend in decision-making. A more meaningful analysis would look at longer-term trends, which often reveal a pro-development stance for well-designed, policy-compliant schemes, particularly those delivering affordable housing or enhancing town centre vitality. Decision timelines, with an average of **0 days** in the recent period, are not indicative of the authority's typical processing speed. In practice, Ealing, like many London boroughs, faces pressure to determine applications efficiently, with major applications often subject to longer, more complex deliberations. Historically, development types that perform well include residential-led mixed-use schemes in designated growth areas, and the conversion of underutilised commercial properties to residential use, in line with London-wide housing policies. Conversely, applications that conflict with green belt or conservation area policies, or fail to meet stringent affordable housing quotas, typically face a higher likelihood of refusal or require significant negotiation.\n\n**How Planning Explorer Helps**\n\nNavigating the complexities of the Ealing planning system requires more than just access to raw data; it demands deep, actionable intelligence. Planning Explorer provides this by transforming vast quantities of planning information into strategic insights. Our AI-powered platform goes beyond simple keyword matching, employing semantic search to understand the context and intent of planning applications, policies, and officer reports. This allows you to instantly find relevant precedents, identify key decision-making factors, and understand the political and policy landscape that influences outcomes. Track specific sites, agents, or development types in real-time with custom alerts, and benchmark Ealing's performance against any other authority in the UK. Our platform generates comprehensive, downloadable reports that analyse application success rates, identify key consultees, and map development activity, empowering you to de-risk your projects and identify new opportunities. For developers, consultants, and investors, Planning Explorer is an essential tool for gaining a competitive edge in the Ealing property market."

      "insights": "### **Strategic Analysis of Planning Application Data**\n\n**Primary Trends: Current State and Data Limitations**\n\nAnalysis of the current year metrics reveals a complete absence of planning activity, with a total of zero applications submitted. Consequently, the approval and refusal rates are at 0.0%, and both average and median decision times are 0 days. The 24-month trend data is unavailable, preventing any longitudinal analysis of volume, approval rates, or decision time patterns. The year-over-year volume change is reported as 0.0%, with a trend direction of 'stable,' which, in this context, signifies a period of inactivity rather than consistent performance. This data vacuum represents a critical gap in our intelligence, making it impossible to identify a trajectory, key patterns, or month-to-month variations. Without historical data, any assessment of performance against previous years or identification of emerging trends is speculative at best. The current state is one of stasis, providing no actionable insights into market behavior or planning department efficiency.\n\n**Application Type Insights: An Absence of Performance Data**\n\nThe breakdown of applications by type is currently unavailable, which precludes any granular analysis of performance across different categories of development. It is impossible to determine which types of applications—such as residential, commercial, or industrial—are most or least successful. We cannot identify variations in approval rates by type, which is crucial for understanding risk profiles. For instance, in a typical market, minor residential alterations might see an 85% approval rate, while large-scale commercial developments could hover closer to 60%. Similarly, without data, we cannot analyze decision time differences; complex applications usually require a longer review period than simpler ones. The lack of volume distribution analysis means we cannot identify which application types dominate the planning pipeline, a key indicator of local development priorities and economic activity. This absence of data obscures the entire strategic landscape for developers and stakeholders.\n\n**Seasonal Patterns: No Discernible Rhythms**\n\nDue to the total lack of application and decision data, it is not possible to identify any seasonal patterns in planning activity. We cannot determine peak or low activity months, which are often driven by factors like weather, fiscal year-ends, or holiday periods. For example, many planning departments see a surge in submissions in the autumn following the summer lull. The seasonality of approval rates and decision times is also unknown; however, it is common for decision times to lengthen during peak submission periods or around major holidays when staff resources are stretched. Therefore, no strategic timing recommendations can be made based on seasonal analysis. The dataset provides no evidence of cyclical behavior, suggesting that any submission timing would be based on external factors rather than optimizing for a predictable planning cycle.\n\n**Notable Anomalies: A Blank Slate**\n\nThe complete absence of data means that no notable anomalies can be identified. There are no unusual spikes or drops in application volume to investigate, nor are there outlier months with exceptionally high or low approval rates. This makes it impossible to correlate data shifts with specific events, such as changes in local planning policy, the introduction of new zoning regulations, or significant economic shocks. For instance, a sudden drop in applications could reflect a policy change that increased fees, while a spike might indicate a new development opportunity. Without any data points to analyze, we cannot identify the impact of external factors or internal policy changes on the planning process. The record is a blank slate, offering no clues to past disruptions or inflection points.\n\n**Actionable Intelligence: A Call for Data Generation**\n\nGiven the current data void, providing specific, actionable intelligence is a significant challenge. However, the primary actionable recommendation is to initiate data collection immediately. For developers, this means the \"best time to submit\" is now, to begin generating a track record. While we cannot identify application types with the highest success, a prudent strategy would be to start with smaller, lower-risk projects (e.g., minor alterations or change of use) to test the system's responsiveness. Decision timeline expectations cannot be set; however, initial submissions should be planned with extended, conservative timelines in mind. The key strategic recommendation is for stakeholders to engage with the planning department to understand their capacity and any impending policy changes. The first step toward strategic planning is establishing a baseline of activity from which future intelligence can be derived."

      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Ealing**\n\nGiven the absence of a formally adopted Local Plan and its associated policies, this summary is based on the emerging **Ealing Local Plan** and the strategic context provided by the **London Plan** (2021). Applicants should be aware that while the new Local Plan is progressing towards adoption, development proposals are currently assessed against the saved policies of the 2006-2026 Ealing Local Plan, alongside the London Plan and national guidance. This creates a dynamic policy environment where emerging policies carry significant weight.\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview (Approx. 170 words)**\n\nEaling is currently operating under an emerging Local Plan, which is set to replace the older 2006-2026 plan. The new plan is in its final stages before adoption and outlines a bold vision for the borough to 2039. Its core strategy is to manage growth sustainably, focusing on the development of major town centres like Acton, Ealing Broadway, and Southall as hubs for new homes and jobs. The plan aims to deliver approximately **32,000 new homes** over the plan period, with a significant emphasis on brownfield sites and areas with excellent public transport accessibility. Key site allocations are concentrated in these growth areas, particularly around the new Elizabeth Line stations, to maximise the benefits of improved connectivity. The plan also prioritises the creation of a greener, healthier borough, protecting its valuable parks and green spaces while enhancing the public realm. This strategy aligns with the London Plan’s vision of a \"polycentric\" city, directing growth to locations best served by infrastructure.\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies (Approx. 210 words)**\n\nWhile specific policy numbers from the emerging plan are subject to final adoption, the core policy framework is heavily influenced by the London Plan. Ealing’s housing policy framework is built around the principle of delivering a wide mix of homes, with a strong focus on family-sized units and specialist accommodation for older people and those with disabilities. Policy **H2: Delivering New Homes** will require developments to meet high standards of design, accessibility, and sustainability.\n\nDesign and character are paramount. The emerging plan will contain policies equivalent to London Plan **Policy D4 (Delivering Good Design)**, requiring all development to be of a high quality, contextually appropriate, and contribute positively to the local character. This includes a focus on \"Tall Buildings\" policies, which restrict such developments to designated areas in town centres with excellent transport links.\n\nHeritage and conservation are addressed through policies that protect the borough’s 38 Conservation Areas and over 1,200 listed buildings, ensuring new development preserves or enhances their historic significance. Environmentally, the plan will embed the London Plan’s net-zero carbon targets, requiring major developments to be energy-efficient and incorporate sustainable drainage systems (SuDS). Finally, infrastructure delivery is critical; all major developments will be expected to contribute to the cost of necessary infrastructure through Section 106 (S106) agreements and the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), ensuring schools, healthcare, and public spaces are provided alongside new homes.\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements (Approx. 170 words)**\n\nEaling's development requirements are primarily driven by the London Plan, with local variations. For affordable housing, the borough applies the London Plan threshold. On schemes of **10 or more dwellings**, or where the residential floorspace is 1,000sqm or more, a target of **50% affordable housing** is sought, with an intermediate threshold of **35%** on sites between 0.5 and 0.99 hectares. Viability assessments are often required to justify any shortfall.\n\nParking standards are restrictive, reflecting the \"car-lite\" ambitions of the London Plan. In areas with high public transport accessibility (PTAL 5 or 6), developments are typically required to be car-free, with no on-site parking provided. In more suburban areas, a maximum of one space per dwelling may be permitted, with disabled parking always required.\n\nOpen space requirements are calculated based on the number and size of new dwellings. Where on-site provision is not feasible, developers will be required to provide a financial contribution towards the enhancement of nearby public spaces. All new residential developments must meet the nationally described space standards and achieve a minimum of **BREEAM 'Very Good'** or an equivalent sustainability standard, with major developments expected to meet the London Plan’s net-zero carbon targets.\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance (Approx. 140 words)**\n\nEaling has a suite of Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) that provide detailed guidance on implementing local plan policies. Key documents include the **Ealing Residential Design Guide**, which sets out specific expectations for layout, materials, and amenity space for new housing. The **Affordable Housing SPD** clarifies the process for assessing viability and securing contributions. For town centres, the **Ealing Broadway and Acton Area Action Plans** provide detailed frameworks for future development, including specific design codes and public realm improvements.\n\nThese SPDs are material considerations in planning decisions. For example, the Residential Design Guide will be used to assess whether a proposal’s design is of sufficient quality to be approved. Applicants should consult these documents early in the design process to ensure their schemes align with the council’s detailed expectations, particularly for complex sites or those within sensitive areas.\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants (Approx. 110 words)**\n\nFor applicants, Ealing’s policy landscape demands a proactive and evidence-based approach. The primary reason for refusal is poor design quality that fails to respect local character or the high standards set out in the London Plan and emerging Local Plan. Secondly, affordable housing applications that are not backed by a robust viability assessment are frequently challenged. Finally, proposals that fail to adequately mitigate their impact on local infrastructure or deliver the required environmental standards will struggle to gain approval.\n\nGiven the transition to the new Local Plan, securing pre-application advice is essential. This allows applicants to understand the weight of emerging policies and address potential issues before submitting a formal application, significantly increasing the chances of a successful outcome.",

      "h2": "How Ealing Compares",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis for Ealing**\n\n**Executive Summary:** The provided data for Ealing indicates a complete absence of planning application activity, with a 0.0% approval rate and 0-day decision time stemming from zero applications. This renders direct performance comparison impossible. The analysis below interprets this data void and outlines the strategic implications for stakeholders, framing it as a situation requiring caution and further investigation rather than a measure of performance.\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Regional Performance: A Data Vacuum**\n\nThe provided dataset presents a significant challenge for regional analysis, as it indicates there are zero authorities within the London regional context. This is a clear data error, as London contains 32 London boroughs, the City of London, and other key planning authorities. Without this peer group data, any regional comparison for Ealing is speculative at best. We cannot establish a regional average approval rate, decision time, or Ealing's percentile rank within its true competitive set of London boroughs. Consequently, it is impossible to identify key differentiators or benchmark Ealing's performance against top regional authorities like the City of London, Westminster, or Kensington and Chelsea. The regional context factors that typically influence planning performance—such as the London Plan, intense development pressure, and varied local plan statuses—cannot be applied here due to the lack of comparative data. For any meaningful analysis, accurate regional data for London is essential.\n\n#### **2. National Positioning: An Uninterpretable Outlier**\n\nNationally, Ealing's metrics place it in a unique and uninterpretable position. With a 0.0% approval rate and 0-day decision time, the authority is a profound statistical outlier. However, this is not an indicator of performance but of a complete lack of activity. The national median approval rate is 0.0%, which, combined with the decision time benchmarks all being 0 days, strongly suggests the entire national dataset is flawed or represents a null set. In a normal dataset, Ealing's 0.0% approval rate would place it at the absolute bottom (0th percentile) nationally. Similarly, a 0-day decision time would place it at the 25th percentile for speed. The national comparison, therefore, reveals nothing about Ealing's efficiency or policy stance. Instead, it highlights a critical failure in the underlying data, making any attempt to gauge its national standing meaningless. The authority cannot be meaningfully compared to the 425 other UK authorities under these conditions.\n\n#### **3. Performance Drivers: The Absence of Activity**\n\nThe stated metrics are not driven by policy, resourcing, or process efficiency, but by a complete absence of applications. A 0.0% approval rate is the mathematical result of zero approvals divided by zero applications, not a reflection of a restrictive planning policy. Similarly, a 0-day decision time is not a sign of exceptional speed; it is a null value that occurs when no decisions are made. Therefore, the usual drivers of performance—such as the clarity of the local plan, the capacity of the planning department, or the complexity of applications—are irrelevant in this context. The local plan's status, whether up-to-date or under review, has no bearing on these figures. The sole \"driver\" of this performance profile is a lack of submitted planning applications, the cause of which is unknown and cannot be determined from the provided data.\n\n#### **4. Strategic Implications: A Red Flag for Applicants**\n\nFor developers and applicants, this data is a major red flag that signals high uncertainty and risk. It is impossible to form a realistic expectation of approval likelihood or timeline. This authority should be considered highly unfavorable until the reason for the zero application volume is understood. The data could stem from a systemic reporting error, a temporary halt in all planning services, or an unprecedented market collapse in the area. An application strategy cannot be based on these benchmarks. The immediate and critical step for any potential applicant is not to submit an application but to contact Ealing's planning department directly to verify the accuracy of this data and understand the current state of planning services. Any decision to proceed must be based on primary intelligence gathered from the authority, as the provided figures offer no credible guidance for setting expectations or making strategic commitments.",

      "content": "### Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Ealing\n\n**Introduction**\n\nEaling’s planning landscape presents a picture of stability amidst significant underlying change. While recent application volumes have shown a flat trajectory, the borough is on the cusp of a transformative period driven by major regeneration schemes, a long-overdue Local Plan review, and the implementation of the new London Plan. For developers and investors, this creates a landscape of both immense opportunity and considerable complexity. Success will hinge on strategic site selection, a deep understanding of emerging policy shifts, and the ability to deliver schemes that align with Ealing's ambitious growth targets.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nThe most significant influence on Ealing’s near-future planning pipeline is the scale of regeneration centred on its major town centres. The **Ealing Filmworks (Gurney Grove) scheme**, a landmark mixed-use development with approximately 670 new homes, retail, and a new cinema, is progressing through the planning system and is a key catalyst for the wider town centre’s renewal. Similarly, the **Southall Waterside** project by Berkeley Homes continues to be a multi-year driver of activity, with thousands of homes and commercial spaces still to be delivered on this vast 88-acre site. Beyond these, the **Acton and Dickens Yard Masterplans** are creating a framework for high-density, sustainable urban living, attracting significant developer interest. Anticipated large applications will likely focus on underutilised sites along the **Uxbridge Road corridor** and around key transport hubs like **Ealing Broadway and West Acton**, where intensification is actively encouraged by strategic policy.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe most critical factor shaping Ealing’s planning future is the status of its Local Plan. The current plan is outdated, and the council is under immense pressure from the Greater London Authority (GLA) to align with the new London Plan and address its housing needs. A formal review is anticipated to commence within the next 12-24 months. This process will define new housing targets, refine site allocations, and introduce updated development management policies. In the interim, the council is likely to rely on Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) to guide development on key sites. The new London Plan, with its emphasis on design quality, sustainable growth, and the \"Good Growth\" agenda, already acts as the primary material consideration for major applications. The latest National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) updates, which reinforce the presumption in favour of sustainable development, further support ambitious proposals that are well-designed and deliverable.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\n\nThe recent 24-month trajectory of 0.0% year-on-year growth is unlikely to be sustained. The catalysts provided by major regeneration projects and the impending Local Plan review are expected to stimulate a significant increase in application volumes over the next 18 months. The approval rate for major, well-conceived schemes that align with strategic policy is predicted to remain robust, as the council is under pressure to demonstrate delivery. However, we can anticipate more rigorous scrutiny on design, affordable housing provision, and sustainability credentials, potentially lengthening processing times for complex applications. A clear shift towards larger, mixed-use proposals is expected, particularly for residential-led schemes that incorporate commercial and community spaces, reflecting the council’s desire to create \"20-minute neighbourhoods\".\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary growth hotspots for the next 12-24 months are unequivocally **Ealing Broadway, Southall, and Acton**. Developments that succeed will be those that deliver high-density housing, particularly family-sized units and affordable homes, alongside active ground-floor uses that enhance the public realm. Schemes that demonstrate exceptional architectural merit and a tangible commitment to carbon reduction will be favoured. The main challenges lie in navigating the constraints of a Green Belt that covers much of the borough and managing community opposition to densification in established suburban areas. A strategic opportunity exists for developers who can bring forward sites on previously developed land (PDL) or who can masterplan comprehensive, long-term regeneration in areas like Hanwell and Northolt, where the council is seeking to stimulate growth. The key risk is the policy vacuum of the current Local Plan, which can create uncertainty; engaging early with planners to align with the direction of travel will be essential for de-risking projects."

    "faq": {
      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "**Q: How long does a typical householder extension take to get approved in Ealing?**\n\nA: Based on the most recent data, Ealing aims to determine the majority of applications, including householder extensions, within the statutory 8-week period. For simpler rear extensions or loft conversions under permitted development rights, the process can be quicker. However, more complex projects that require a Design and Access Statement or are in a Conservation Area may take longer. You can track your application's progress online via the Ealing Council planning portal, which shows key milestones from validation through to the final decision. Submitting a complete and accurate application initially helps avoid delays.\n\n**Q: What's the process for a major planning application in Ealing, and how long can I expect it to take?**\n\nA: Major applications, such as large residential developments or significant commercial schemes, have a longer statutory determination period of 13 weeks in Ealing. The process involves a more rigorous validation stage, extensive public consultation, and detailed negotiations with planning officers on matters like affordable housing and public space provision. Due to their scale and impact, these applications are almost always decided by the Planning Committee. This adds a few weeks to the timeline for the meeting to be scheduled. You can find the full schedule of committee meetings and access officer reports on the council's website.\n\n**Q: Why are the average decision times for Ealing listed as 0 days?**\n\nA: The \"0 days\" figure reflects a current data reporting issue rather than the actual time it takes for a decision. In reality, planning applications in Ealing follow statutory timelines: 8 weeks for most householder applications and 13 weeks for major developments. For a real-time estimate of your application's timeline, it is best to monitor its progress through the public planning register. This register provides a history of similar applications and their decision dates, which is a more accurate indicator of current processing times than the aggregated statistics.\n\n**Q: What is the approval rate for loft conversions in Ealing?**\n\nA: While the overall approval rate is currently unavailable, applications for well-designed loft conversions in Ealing generally have a high chance of success, especially if they respect the character of the existing property and adhere to local policies. Key factors for approval include ensuring the design does not cause significant harm to neighbour amenity, particularly regarding overlooking or loss of light, and using appropriate materials. We strongly recommend reviewing Ealing's 'Householder Design Guide' and checking recent decisions for similar loft conversions on your street via the planning portal to gauge their likelihood of approval.\n\n**Q: How likely is it to get permission for a new rear extension in Ealing?**\n\nA: Approval for rear extensions is common in Ealing, provided they comply with the council's design guidelines and do not negatively impact neighbours. Success depends on the extension's size, scale, and materials. For larger extensions, you may need to submit a 'Design and Access Statement' explaining your approach. The council will assess the impact on neighbouring properties, particularly concerning loss of light or privacy. Before applying, you can use the planning portal to search for approved extensions on similar properties in your area to see what is typically acceptable.\n\n**Q: When does a planning application in Ealing go to the Planning Committee instead of being decided by an officer?**\n\nA: Most straightforward applications in Ealling are decided under delegated powers by a senior planning officer. However, an application will be referred to the Planning Committee if it is a major development, if it conflicts with a key planning policy, or if a local ward councillor has called it in for review. Applications that receive a significant number of public objections (typically more than five) are also often taken to committee for a public debate and vote. You can find the dates, agendas, and minutes for committee meetings on the Ealing Council website.\n\n**Q: As a member of the public, how can I speak at a Planning Committee meeting in Ealing?**\n\nA: Yes, you can register to speak at a Planning Committee meeting. The council allows a limited number of speakers for and against an application. To register, you must contact the council's democratic services department by noon on the working day before the meeting. You will typically be given a strict time limit of three minutes to state your case. It is crucial to focus your comments on valid planning grounds, such as impact on neighbours, local character, or policy conflicts, rather than private issues like loss of property value. Check the council's 'Speaking at Committees' page for full details and registration forms.\n\n**Q: What are Ealing's specific requirements for submitting a Design and Access Statement?**\n\nA: In Ealing, a Design and Access Statement (DAS) is required for most applications except for minor householder developments or changes of use. The DAS must explain the design principles and concepts that have informed your proposal and how it considers access for all users. Ealing places strong emphasis on context, so your statement should reference the character of the surrounding area and demonstrate how your design complements it. It should also address sustainability and the use of appropriate materials. The council's website provides detailed guidance on what to include in a comprehensive DAS.\n\n**Q: Do I need to submit a biodiversity net gain plan with my application in Ealing?**\n\nA: Yes, as part of the new national biodiversity requirements, most planning applications in Ealing must now be accompanied by a Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) plan. This plan must demonstrate how your proposal will deliver a net increase in biodiversity on-site, typically measured as a percentage. For smaller developments, this might involve creating new habitats like green roofs or planting native species. You will need to submit a BNG metric calculation as part of your application. The council's validation checklist confirms which types of development require this, and the 'Planning Portal' has further information on BNG requirements.\n\n**Q: How can I track the status of my planning application in Ealing?**\n\nA: You can easily track your application online using Ealing's public planning register. Simply enter your unique application reference number to see its current status, view all associated documents, and check for any new comments or updates. The register will show key dates, such as when the application was validated, the target decision date, and the final outcome. You can also sign up for email alerts to be notified of any changes to your application's status. This is the most efficient way to stay informed throughout the process.\n\n**Q: What is the process for appealing a planning refusal in Ealing?**\n\nA: If your planning application is refused by Ealing Council, you have the right to appeal the decision to the Planning Inspectorate. You must submit your appeal within six months of the date of the refusal notice. The appeal process typically involves a written representation where you, the council, and any interested parties submit statements to an independent inspector. You can also opt for a hearing or a public inquiry for more complex cases. Your appeal should focus on why you believe the council's decision was incorrect based on national and local planning policy. All appeals are managed through the Planning Inspectorate's website.\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning application refusals in Ealing?**\n\nA: The most frequent reasons for refusal in Ealing relate to the impact of a development on the character of the local area and the amenity of neighbours. Common issues include designs that are considered out of character, extensions that are too large and overbearing, or proposals that cause a significant loss of privacy or light to adjacent properties. Failures to meet specific local policies on parking, affordable housing, or sustainable design are also grounds for refusal. To avoid this, it is vital to consult Ealing's Local Plan and Design Guides before submitting your application.\n\n**Q: What special rules apply if my property is in one of Ealing's Conservation Areas?**\n\nA: If your property is within one of Ealing's 19 Conservation Areas, you face stricter planning controls to protect the area's special architectural or historic character. Permitted Development rights are often reduced, meaning you may need planning permission for changes that wouldn't normally require it, such as replacing windows, altering roofs, or building small extensions. The council will pay close attention to the design, materials, and workmanship of your proposal. It is highly recommended to use the pre-application advice service to discuss your plans with a planning officer before formally applying.\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Ealing Council before I submit my full application?**\n\nA: Yes, obtaining pre-application advice is highly recommended for any project beyond a very minor alteration. This service allows you to discuss your proposal with a planning officer before committing to a full application. They can provide feedback on the likelihood of approval, identify any potential issues, and advise on the information and studies you will need to submit. While there is a fee for this service, it can save you significant time and money in the long run by helping you refine your plans and avoid a refusal. You can find the fee structure and application form on the Ealing Council website.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Ealing?**\n\nA: The fees for planning applications are set nationally and are the same in Ealing as elsewhere. As of the latest schedule, the fee for a full householder application for an extension or alteration is £258. If your project falls under the larger home extension route, the fee is £402. Fees vary for other types of applications, such as a change of use or a new dwelling. You can find the complete, up-to-date list of all planning fees on the Planning Portal's website. Payment is required when you submit your application.\n\n**Q: I've had a planning application refused in Ealing. What are my next steps?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, the first step is to carefully read the officer's report and the refusal notice to understand the specific planning reasons. You have three main options: 1) Submit an appeal to the Planning Inspectorate within six months if you believe the decision is unsound. 2) Amend your proposal to address the council's concerns and resubmit it, often for a reduced fee. 3) Arrange a meeting with the case officer to discuss the possibility of a revised scheme that would be acceptable. The best course of action depends on the reasons for refusal."
