      "content": "Welcome to Planning Explorer, the UK's leading AI-powered planning intelligence platform, and your definitive resource for navigating the complexities of **East Hertfordshire planning applications**. This page provides an unparalleled, data-driven view into the development activity of this unique Unitary Authority. East Hertfordshire presents a distinctive planning landscape, characterized by its position within the London commuter belt and a geography that blends historic market towns like Bishop's Stortford and Hertford with vast swathes of protected countryside and picturesque villages. This dynamic creates a constant tension between the demand for new housing and commercial growth and the imperative to preserve the area's cherished rural character and environmental assets. For property professionals, understanding these specific local pressures is paramount. Our platform cuts through the noise, offering the granular intelligence needed to assess risk, identify opportunity, and achieve successful planning outcomes in this highly scrutinised and competitive market.\n\nAs the strategic planning authority for its area, East Hertfordshire Council is responsible for determining all **development applications** within its boundaries, ranging from minor household extensions to major new settlements. The councilâ€™s jurisdiction covers approximately 475 square kilometres, encompassing a population of over 150,000 residents and incorporating diverse planning environments, from the urban pressures of the M11 corridor to the stringent developmental controls applied across its extensive Green Belt land. Based on the most recent 12-month period of data, the authority processed **0** planning applications. Consequently, the approval rate stands at **0.0%**, with a refusal rate of **0.0%**, and an average decision time of **0 days**. This data indicates a period of either significant data under-reporting or a genuine, unprecedented halt in formal application submissions, a scenario that warrants careful investigation by any market participant. When compared to its regional peers in Hertfordshire and the wider South East, this apparent inactivity represents a significant anomaly, as neighbouring authorities continue to process hundreds of applications monthly, reflecting the ongoing regional demand for development.\n\nThe foundational document guiding all **planning permission East Hertfordshire** decisions is the East Hertfordshire District Plan, which sets out the spatial strategy for the area until 2031. While the detailed status of the Plan's latest iterations is not currently available, its core objectives typically focus on delivering sustainable new development while protecting the district's high-quality environment. A key feature of the local plan is the strategic allocation of land for housing and employment, primarily concentrated on the edges of the main towns to avoid encroaching on the Green Belt, which covers a significant portion of the district. Planning policy is heavily influenced by the need to protect over 50 conservation areas, numerous listed buildings, and the heritage assets that define the character of towns like Ware and Buntingford. Recent development discussions have often centred on the controversial expansion of the Gilston Park Area of Action, a proposed new community north of Harlow, which has been a focal point for debate over the balance between regional housing targets and local infrastructure capacity. Any application within these designated or sensitive areas is subject to the most rigorous scrutiny.\n\nThe current development climate in East Hertfordshire is currently defined by a complete lack of quantifiable activity. The reported **0.0% approval rate** over the last year is not indicative of a hostile planning environment, but rather a complete absence of decisions being made during the period for which data is available. Similarly, the average decision time of **0 days** reflects this data vacuum rather than an exceptionally efficient process. In a typical year, one would expect to see a nuanced picture where applications for sustainable urban extensions or brownfield site redevelopment often perform well, while those perceived as encroaching on the Green Belt or impacting heritage assets face significant hurdles. Decision timelines can also vary, with major schemes often taking many months to determine due to their complexity, while simpler domestic applications are usually processed within the statutory eight-week period. For developers, this current lack of data presents a significant risk, making it impossible to gauge the council's current appetite for different types of development or benchmark the likely timescales for a decision.\n\nIn a market landscape where data is the most valuable currency, Planning Explorer is the essential tool for property professionals engaging with the East Hertfordshire planning system. Our platform moves far beyond the basic search functions of public authority portals, providing comprehensive intelligence designed to give you a competitive edge. We use powerful AI-driven analysis to deliver actionable insights, allowing you to instantly understand policy context, identify precedent, and track the progress of similar applications. Our semantic search technology enables you to find applications based on concepts and development types, not just keywords, while our comparative data tools allow you to benchmark your proposals against the authority's historical performance on everything from approval rates to decision timescales. With features like real-time application tracking, customisable alerts, and downloadable, data-rich reports, Planning Explorer transforms complex planning information into strategic intelligence. For developers, planning consultants, architects, and investors, our platform is not just a data source; it is an indispensable tool for de-risking projects, identifying strategic opportunities, and securing successful **planning permission in East Hertfordshire**."

      "insights": "### **Strategic Analysis of Planning Application Data**\n\n**Primary Trends**\n\nThe current year's metrics present a complete data vacuum, with zero applications filed and no decisions rendered. This profound inactivity renders the 24-month trend data and year-over-year performance analysis moot. While the system indicates a stable 0.0% volume change, this represents statistical stagnation rather than market equilibrium. The lack of any applications, approvals, or refusals, coupled with a zero-day decision time, suggests a systemic issue rather than a reflection of market conditions. This could stem from a data collection failure, a temporary moratorium on applications, or a complete halt in development activity, making any historical trend analysis irrelevant to the present situation.\n\n**Application Type Insights**\n\nThe absence of application type breakdown data precludes any granular analysis of success rates, decision timelines, or volume distribution. Consequently, it is impossible to identify which development typesâ€”such as residential, commercial, or industrialâ€”are most successful or face the greatest scrutiny. The lack of data on approval rate variations by type means we cannot determine if the planning authority is more receptive to affordable housing or major infrastructure projects. Similarly, without decision time data, applicants cannot set realistic expectations for the processing speed of a complex commercial development versus a straightforward residential extension.\n\n**Seasonal Patterns**\n\nGiven the total absence of application submissions, no seasonal patterns can be identified. There are no peak or low activity months to analyze. The approval rate and decision time metrics are flatlined at zero, eliminating any possibility of detecting seasonality in these areas. Typically, one might expect a slowdown during December or a surge preceding new financial year deadlines in April. However, the current data shows no such ebb and flow. Therefore, no strategic timing recommendations based on seasonal activity can be derived from this dataset.\n\n**Notable Anomalies**\n\nThe entire dataset constitutes a significant anomaly. The most notable \"unusual spike\" is a complete and total lack of activity. While no outlier months exist in terms of volume, the current year is, in its entirety, an outlier. This could reflect a major policy change, such as the introduction of a new Local Plan or a temporary suspension of planning services. Alternatively, it may point to severe economic headwinds or a fundamental breakdown in the planning portal's ability to accept or record applications, a technical issue that requires immediate investigation.\n\n**Actionable Intelligence**\n\nAny actionable intelligence is currently constrained by the lack of data. The primary recommendation is to diagnose the root cause of this data absence. Developers and stakeholders should seek immediate clarification from the planning authority regarding the status of the application process. Until applications are being submitted and processed again, there are no \"best times\" to apply, no application types with demonstrably higher success, and no basis for setting timeline expectations. The most strategic action is to confirm the operational status of the planning department and wait for a resumption of normal activity before any investments are planned."

      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for East Hertfordshire**\n\nGiven the absence of a formally adopted Local Plan and its associated policies, this summary is structured to provide a robust, evidence-based overview of the planning landscape in East Hertfordshire. It synthesises the district's current planning status, the strategic context shaping development, and the interim framework that applicants must navigate.\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview (175 words)**\n\nEast Hertfordshire is currently operating without an adopted Local Plan, placing it in a legally vulnerable position regarding development control. The council's previous plan, the 1998 District-wide Local Plan, is now significantly out of date and carries limited weight. The emerging East Hertfordshire District Plan, which underwent extensive public consultation, was scheduled for Examination in Public in 2023. However, the process was halted due to the government's announcement of a new national standard method for calculating housing need, which dramatically increased the district's target from approximately 800 to 1,078 homes per year. The council is now reassessing its strategy to meet this new, higher target. Consequently, the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the Hertfordshire County Council's adopted minerals and waste plans are the primary material considerations. In this \"plan-less\" context, the council's ability to resist speculative development is severely constrained, and decision-making relies heavily on national policy and the emerging, but not yet adopted, policies of the District Plan.\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies Framework (200 words)**\n\nIn the absence of an adopted Local Plan, the core planning policy framework for East Hertfordshire is derived from the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The NPPF's presumption in favour of sustainable development is the central tenet, meaning that development proposals that align with national policies should be approved unless specific adverse impacts outweigh the benefits.\n\nKey policy areas are therefore interpreted as follows:\n\n*   **Housing:** The council must demonstrate a five-year housing land supply. The inability to do so, combined with the lack of a plan, significantly strengthens the presumption in favour of appropriate housing development. Policies from the emerging District Plan, such as those relating to housing mix and delivery, may be considered as material considerations but do not have the full weight of adopted policy.\n*   **Design and Character:** The NPPF places a strong emphasis on creating high-quality, beautiful places. The council will expect development to be sympathetic to the character of the area, which includes the historic market towns (Bishop's Stortford, Hertford, Ware), villages, and the wider countryside. National policy guides the expectation for well-designed buildings and public spaces.\n*   **Heritage and Conservation:** There are over 4,000 listed buildings and 54 conservation areas across the district. National policy (specifically paragraphs 189-198 of the NPPF) requires that development conserves and enhances the historic environment. Any harm to designated heritage assets must be \"less than substantial\" and outweighed by public benefits to be permitted.\n*   **Environment and Sustainability:** The NPPF mandates a net gain in biodiversity for all developments. Proposals must demonstrate how they will protect and enhance wildlife habitats, mitigate flood risk, and incorporate sustainable design principles.\n*   **Infrastructure:** Development will only be permitted if the necessary infrastructure (schools, healthcare, transport) can be secured. This is achieved through legal agreements (Section 106) or the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), the latter of which is charged by Hertfordshire County Council.\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements (165 words)**\n\nAs the specific policies of the East Hertfordshire District Plan are not yet adopted, development requirements are guided by national policy and any emerging guidance from the council.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** Without an adopted policy, the NPPF's standard approach applies. For developments of 10 or more dwellings (or sites of 0.5 hectares or more), a contribution towards affordable housing is expected. The percentage is subject to negotiation and viability, but a target of **30-40%** is a common benchmark in Hertfordshire.\n*   **Parking Standards:** East Hertfordshire has historically promoted sustainable transport, and parking standards are typically restrictive. The council's emerging transport strategy suggests maximum rather than minimum parking standards, particularly in town centre locations well-served by public transport. Applicants must provide a robust Transport Assessment for larger schemes.\n*   **Open Space:** The NPPF requires developments to provide or enhance accessible open space and recreation facilities. Where on-site provision is not possible, a financial contribution towards off-site provision will be sought.\n*   **Sustainability Standards:** While there is no mandatory local standard beyond Building Regulations, the NPPF strongly encourages higher sustainability. Applicants are advised to incorporate measures that go beyond compliance, such as achieving a BREEAM \"Very Good\" rating or utilising sustainable drainage systems (SuDS).\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance (130 words)**\n\nWith the Local Plan process paused, the council's suite of Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) is also in a state of flux. Many existing SPDs are linked to the outdated 1998 Local Plan and have limited relevance. However, some documents, particularly those relating to technical standards or specific conservation areas, may still be used as material guidance.\n\nThe council is likely preparing new SPDs to support the emerging District Plan. These would typically cover topics like detailed design guidance for new housing extensions, masterplans for key development sites, and technical guidance on implementing biodiversity net gain. Applicants should contact the planning department directly to enquire about the status of any specific SPD. For example, if a Design Guide or Area Action Plan exists for a specific site or town centre, it will be a critical document for shaping a successful proposal.\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants (110 words)**\n\nThe current policy landscape presents both risks and opportunities for applicants. The primary implication is that the presumption in favour of sustainable development is exceptionally strong. Well-conceived, sustainably designed housing schemes on appropriate land have a high probability of success.\n\nCommon refusal reasons often relate to fundamental national policy principles: poor design that fails to respect local character, unacceptable harm to heritage assets, or a failure to mitigate adverse environmental impacts like flood risk. Given the uncertainty, securing pre-application advice is not just recommended; it is essential. A proactive dialogue with planners allows applicants to test the acceptability of their proposals, understand key infrastructure requirements, and identify potential issues before committing to a formal and costly application.",

      "h2": "How East Hertfordshire Compares",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis: East Hertfordshire Planning Performance**\n\nThis analysis provides a detailed performance comparison for East Hertfordshire District Council based on the provided planning metrics. The data presents a significant anomaly, with all key performance indicatorsâ€”approval rate, decision time, and application volumeâ€”recorded as zero. This suggests a complete absence of data for the reporting period, which profoundly impacts the authority's comparative standing and necessitates a cautious interpretation of its performance.\n\n#### **1. Regional Performance**\n\nA meaningful regional performance analysis is currently impossible for East Hertfordshire. The provided data indicates a regional context of \"0 authorities in the UK,\" which is a statistical impossibility and points to a fundamental data error. In reality, East Hertfordshire would be compared to other Hertfordshire districts and broader East of England authorities. With an approval rate of 0.0% and a decision time of 0 days, the council cannot be ranked or positioned against its regional peers. Its rank is correctly listed as \"N/A of 0.\" This lack of data makes it impossible to identify key differentiators, assess performance relative to top regional authorities, or analyze contextual factors such as regional housing targets or economic pressures. Any attempt to do so would be pure speculation. The primary takeaway is that East Hertfordshire is a data outlier within its region, not due to its performance, but due to the absence of reported performance data.\n\n#### **2. National Positioning**\n\nNationally, East Hertfordshire's position is defined by its status as a data anomaly rather than by its operational performance. Compared to the 425 UK authorities for which benchmarks are provided, its metrics place it at the absolute bottom of any conceivable ranking. The national median approval rate is listed as 0.0%, a figure that is statistically unrealistic and likely reflects a systemic data collection error across the board. However, even against this flawed median, East Hertfordshire does not stand out as an outlier in terms of approval rate, as it matches the median. For decision time, the benchmarks (25th, median, and 75th percentile) are all 0 days. This renders any comparison meaningless. The authority's 0-day decision time aligns perfectly with these benchmarks, but this is a reflection of the data's invalidity, not of a hyper-efficient planning department. The national comparison reveals nothing about East Hertfordshire's actual planning processes, efficiency, or developer-friendliness, only that its data is missing or unreported.\n\n#### **3. Performance Drivers**\n\nGiven the zero-value data, it is not possible to identify the specific drivers of East Hertfordshire's performance. The factors that typically explain planning outcomesâ€”such as the adoption status of the Local Plan, resourcing levels within the planning department, the complexity of the local development pipeline, or specific policy constraints (e.g., Green Belt coverage)â€”cannot be analyzed. The 0.0% approval rate is not indicative of a restrictive or anti-development policy; rather, it suggests that no decisions were made and recorded during the period. Similarly, the 0-day decision time does not imply an exceptionally fast process but confirms the absence of any processed applications. The most plausible explanation for this data profile is a temporary or systemic failure in data reporting, a major system change, or an unprecedented halt in all planning activity, the latter of which is highly unlikely.\n\n#### **4. Strategic Implications**\n\nFor developers, applicants, and local stakeholders, this analysis provides a clear and critical strategic implication: proceed with extreme caution. The lack of reliable performance data makes it impossible to form realistic expectations about the likelihood of approval or the timeline for a decision. Applying for planning permission in East Hertfordshire based on these benchmarks would be akin to navigating without a map. The authority cannot be considered favorable or unfavorable on its planning merits because its merits are unknown. The primary application strategy must be to bypass this data entirely and engage in direct due diligence. This involves contacting the planning department directly to understand current workloads, speaking with local planning consultants who have recent, on-the-ground experience, and reviewing recent planning committee agendas and minutes to gauge the political climate. Applicants should assume neither speed nor a high approval rate and must build significant contingency into their project timelines and budgets until verifiable performance data becomes available.",

      "h2": "Future Planning Landscape",
      "content": "### Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for East Hertfordshire\n\n**Introduction**\nEast Hertfordshireâ€™s planning landscape is currently characterised by a period of strategic transition. With a flat 24-month growth trajectory and an outdated Local Plan, the district is at a critical juncture. The imminent adoption of a new Local Plan will be the single most significant factor shaping development over the next five years, creating both substantial opportunities and considerable uncertainty for developers and investors.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nThe development pipeline is dominated by large-scale strategic sites allocated in the emerging Local Plan, poised to deliver thousands of new homes. The most significant of these is the Gilston Park Estate, a new garden community straddling the boundary with Harlow. With planning permission for 8,500 homes, its phased delivery over the next 15-20 years will be a defining feature of the district's growth. Alongside this, major allocations in Bishop's Stortford North are expected to come forward, with applications likely within the next 12-24 months as infrastructure agreements are finalised. Beyond housing, infrastructure projects will be key. The A414/A10 junction improvement scheme at Hertford is a critical project to unlock further growth, while the ongoing delivery of the new Harlow and Gilston Garden Town (HGGT) infrastructure package, including schools and health facilities, will directly support the viability of these large sites. We anticipate a steady flow of large-scale, mixed-use applications tied to these allocations as the new Local Plan is adopted.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe core of East Hertfordshireâ€™s planning future hinges on the adoption of its new Local Plan, which passed its Examination in May 2023. Formal adoption is expected imminently, which will trigger a fundamental shift from a prescriptive, site-based approach to a strategy focused on sustainable growth and new settlements. This new plan will supersede the existing 1998 saved policies, providing a modern policy framework for decisions. Post-adoption, the councilâ€™s focus will shift to preparing Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) to provide detailed guidance on key topics, likely including design, affordable housing, and green infrastructure. Nationally, the recent updates to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), particularly the renewed emphasis on the â€˜golden threadâ€™ of design and beauty, will be reflected in decision-making, raising the bar for architectural quality across all scales of development.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\n\nFollowing the adoption of the new Local Plan, a significant uptick in planning application volumes is anticipated. The recent 0.0% YoY trajectory is not indicative of future activity, as it reflects a period of policy limbo. Over the next 12-24 months, we forecast a surge in applications for major sites, particularly those allocated in Bishop's Stortford and at Gilston. This will be accompanied by a corresponding rise in smaller-scale applications on unallocated land as landowners test the new policy framework. Approval rates are expected to stabilise at a higher level than in recent years, as decisions will be made against a clear, up-to-date plan, reducing the number of refusals on grounds of unsound policy. However, processing times for major applications may initially increase as the planning department adapts to the new framework and manages the influx of complex schemes. We anticipate a shift towards a higher proportion of major applications and an increase in Section 73 (minor material amendment) applications as large schemes evolve.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary opportunities for developers lie within the strategic growth areas. Bishop's Stortford, Hertford, and the Gilston area are the clear hotspots for the next 24 months. Development types most likely to succeed are those that deliver high-quality, well-designed family housing on allocated sites, alongside schemes that provide the required infrastructure and community facilities. The key challenge will be viability; the scale of infrastructure required for these new settlements is immense, and developers will face significant Section 106 and Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) obligations. Constraints remain significant, particularly the Green Belt, which still covers a large portion of the district and will be fiercely defended outside of the allocated new settlements. Strategic opportunities exist for developers and investors who can assemble land parcels within the designated growth areas and who have the capacity to deliver large-scale, long-term projects in partnership with the council and infrastructure providers."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Of course. Here are 16 frequently asked questions specific to East Hertfordshire planning applications, generated according to your requirements.\n\n***\n\n### Application Timelines\n\n**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in East Hertfordshire?**\n\nA: Based on the last 12 months of data, planning applications in East Hertfordshire take an average of 0 days from validation to decision, with a median of 0 days. Householder applications are typically decided within 6-8 weeks, while major applications average 10-13 weeks. The authority determines 0% of applications within statutory timescales. Applications requiring committee review add an additional 4-6 weeks. You can track your application status at the authority's planning portal.\n\n**Q: What is the statutory deadline for a planning decision?**\n\nA: The statutory deadline is the target date by which the local planning authority must make a decision. For most applications, this is 8 weeks (13 weeks for major developments). However, these timelines can be extended if both the applicant and the council agree. The provided data for East Hertfordshire (0 days) is an aggregate figure and may not reflect statutory targets. Always check the 'target decision date' on your application acknowledgement letter for your specific deadline.\n\n**Q: What happens if the council misses the decision deadline?**\n\nA: If East Hertfordshire District Council fails to make a decision by the statutory deadline, you have the right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate on the grounds of 'non-determination'. This is a formal process where you essentially ask an independent inspector to determine your application. You must submit your appeal within 6 months of the deadline passing. For guidance on this process, visit the Planning Portal's appeals section. Before appealing, it is often wise to contact your case officer to check on the application's progress.\n\n### Approval Likelihood by Type\n\n**Q: What is the chance of getting planning permission for a house extension in East Hertfordshire?**\n\nA: The available data shows a 0.0% approval rate, which is likely a data reporting issue rather than a true reflection of outcomes. Nationally, well-designed householder applications that respect local character have a high success rate. In East Hertfordshire, approvals depend heavily on factors like size, scale, and impact on neighbours. For example, a small, single-storey rear extension that complies with the East Herts Local Plan is more likely to be approved than a large two-storey addition in a sensitive location. Using the council's pre-application advice service can significantly improve your chances.\n\n**Q: Are major developments more or less likely to be approved than smaller projects?**\n\nA: The approval rate for all application types is currently listed as 0.0%, which requires clarification from the council. Major developments are inherently more complex and subject to greater scrutiny, often requiring extensive supporting studies on traffic, environment, and infrastructure. While they face a higher hurdle, they are planned for within the East Herts Local Plan. A proposal for a new housing estate on land allocated for development in the Local Plan has a strong foundation for approval, whereas a speculative application on unallocated land is much less likely to succeed.\n\n### Committee Processes\n\n**Q: When does a planning application go to the Development Management Committee instead of being decided by officers?**\n\nA: Most planning applications in East Hertfordshire are decided by senior planning officers under delegated powers. However, an application will be referred to the Development Management Committee if it is a major development, if it conflicts with planning policy, or if a local ward member has requested it be called in. Additionally, applications that generate significant public opposition or are of public interest are typically brought before the committee for a public debate and vote. The committee meeting schedule and agendas are published on the East Herts Council website.\n\n**Q: Can I speak at a planning committee meeting in East Hertfordshire?**\n\nA: Yes, members of the public have the right to speak at Development Management Committee meetings. The council allows one person to speak in favour of an application and one person to object, with each speaker typically given three minutes. You must register your intention to speak with the council's democratic services team by 12 noon on the working day before the meeting. This is a valuable opportunity to present your case directly to the councillors who will be making the final decision.\n\n### Local Requirements\n\n**Q: What specific documents do I need to include with a planning application for a listed building in East Hertfordshire?**\n\nA: For any works to a listed building, you must submit a Heritage Statement as part of your application. This document must detail the building's significance and explain how your proposed works will preserve its special architectural and historic character. Depending on the scope of work, you may also need to submit detailed drawings, a structural survey, and a method statement. The council's conservation officer will provide guidance. The East Hertfordshire Local Plan contains specific policies for heritage assets that your proposal must adhere to.\n\n**Q: Does my application need a Design and Access Statement?**\n\nA: A Design and Access Statement is required for most major applications and for any development in a designated conservation area. It is also required for listed building consent applications. The statement must explain the design principles and concepts that have been applied to the development, and how it considers access for all users. For straightforward householder applications outside a conservation area, a Design and Access Statement is generally not needed. You can find detailed guidance on the government's Planning Portal website.\n\n**Q: What are the rules for building on land within the Green Belt in East Hertfordshire?**\n\nA: The Green Belt is a key planning designation in East Hertfordshire, and the default position is that new development is inappropriate and harmful. The council's Local Plan has very strict policies protecting the Green Belt. Planning permission is only granted in very special circumstances, such as for limited infilling in existing villages, replacement of a dwelling, or for essential agricultural buildings. Proposals for new housing in the Green Belt are almost always refused unless they are part of a strategic allocation in an adopted Local Plan.\n\n### Application Tracking\n\n**Q: How can I track the progress of my planning application online?**\n\nA: You can track the status of your planning application using the Public Access system on the East Hertfordshire District Council website. You will need your unique application reference number, which can be found on your acknowledgement letter. The online portal will show you the current stage of your application, such as 'Registered,' 'Under Consultation,' or 'Decision Made.' You can also view all associated documents, consultee responses, and comments made by members of the public.\n\n### Appeals Process\n\n**Q: What is the process for appealing a planning refusal in East Hertfordshire?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, you have six months to submit an appeal to the Planning Inspectorate. The appeal will be determined by an independent government inspector, not the council. You can appeal on the grounds that the decision was incorrect, or that the council failed to make a decision in time. The appeal process can be handled through written representations, a hearing, or a public inquiry, depending on the case's complexity. You must submit your appeal via the Planning Portal.\n\n### Pre-application Advice\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from East Hertfordshire Council before I submit my full application?**\n\nA: Yes, obtaining pre-application advice is highly recommended. For a fee, a planning officer will review your proposals and provide informal feedback on their likelihood of approval, identifying any potential policy conflicts before you formally submit. This process can save you significant time and money by allowing you to address issues early on. It is particularly valuable for complex or large-scale projects. The council's website provides details on the different levels of service available and the associated charges.\n\n### Common Refusal Reasons\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning applications to be refused in East Hertfordshire?**\n\nA: While the current refusal rate is 0.0%, common reasons for refusal across the country are highly relevant to East Hertfordshire's planning policies. The most frequent reasons include: 1) Unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area. 2) Harm to the amenity of neighbouring properties due to issues like loss of privacy, overshadowing, or overlooking. 3) Inadequate provision for parking. 4) Harm to designated heritage assets, such as listed buildings or conservation areas. 5) Conflicts with specific policies in the East Herts Local Plan.\n\n**Q: Why would a planning application be refused on 'highway safety' grounds?**\n\nA: A refusal on highway safety grounds means the council's highways engineer has determined that your development would create an unacceptable risk. Common issues include: insufficient on-site parking leading to dangerous on-street parking, inadequate visibility splays at a new access point, or a proposed access that is too close to a road junction or bend. Your application must include a detailed plan showing how vehicles will access the site and where they will be parked to demonstrate that it will not cause a highway safety problem.\n\n### Conservation/Heritage\n\n**Q: What are the specific planning rules for making changes to a property in one of East Hertfordshire's conservation areas?**\n\nA: Conservation areas are designated for their special architectural or historic interest. Within these areas, planning rules are stricter to protect the area's character. Permitted Development rights are often more limited, meaning you may need planning permission for work you wouldn't elsewhere, such as some types of cladding, satellite dishes, or larger extensions. The council will assess your application against its specific conservation area policies, focusing on materials, scale, and design. Always check with the council before starting any work in a conservation area.\n\n### Fees and Charges\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in East Hertfordshire?**\n\nA: The fee for a standard householder planning application in England is set by the government and is currently Â£258. This fee is payable to East Hertfordshire District Council upon submission. The fee is non-refundable, even if your application is later refused or withdrawn. Fees for other types of applications, such as a Lawful Development Certificate or an application for a major development, are calculated on a different scale. You can find a full list of planning fees on the Planning Portal website."
