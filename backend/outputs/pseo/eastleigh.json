      "content": "Welcome to Planning Explorer’s definitive resource for planning intelligence in Eastleigh. As the UK's leading AI-powered platform, we provide unparalleled analysis and data-driven insights into the local development landscape. This page serves as your comprehensive guide to navigating the complexities of **Eastleigh planning applications**, offering a clear view of the trends, policies, and opportunities that define the borough’s property market. Eastleigh, a unitary authority in Hampshire, presents a unique and dynamic planning environment characterised by its blend of significant urban centres like Eastleigh and Chandler's Ford, alongside substantial rural communities and valuable green spaces. This mixed geography creates diverse planning pressures, from urban regeneration and town centre living to the sensitive development of its rural hinterland and the protection of its strategic gaps. For property professionals, understanding these nuances is critical to success. Whether you are a developer, investor, or planning consultant, our platform equips you with the granular data and predictive intelligence needed to make informed decisions, identify viable projects, and manage risk effectively within this strategically important part of the South East.\n\n### Planning Jurisdiction & Activity\n\nEastleigh Borough Council operates as the local planning authority for the entire borough, exercising full jurisdiction over all **development applications** ranging from minor household alterations to major strategic housing and commercial schemes. The authority’s geographic scope encompasses approximately 80 square kilometres, including the main urban areas of Eastleigh, Chandler's Ford, and Hedge End, as well as the villages of Bishopstoke, Fair Oak, and West End. This jurisdictional control means the council is solely responsible for determining planning applications, enforcing planning regulations, and shaping the future of the built environment through its local plan.\n\nBased on the most recent 12-month data, the volume of planning activity within Eastleigh stands at a total of 0 applications, with a corresponding approval rate of 0.0% and a refusal rate of 0.0%. The average decision time for applications is currently recorded at 0 days. This data indicates a current pause or anomaly in publicly available application data. In a typical year, Eastleigh would process several hundred applications, reflecting its status as a growth area with significant development pressure. Recent trends observed in comparable authorities across the South East suggest a continued high demand for residential development, particularly for apartments and smaller family homes, alongside a steady flow of commercial and infrastructure projects. While precise regional peer comparisons are unavailable at this moment, authorities with a similar urban-rural mix often grapple with balancing housing targets against the need to protect green belt land and manage urban density, a dynamic that is highly relevant to Eastleigh’s strategic context.\n\n### Local Planning Landscape\n\nThe strategic foundation for all **Eastleigh planning applications** is the Eastleigh Borough Local Plan, which sets out the vision, objectives, and policies for development in the area up to 2036. The plan is a critical document that guides decisions on where and how development should take place, identifying key sites for housing, employment, and community facilities while safeguarding areas of environmental and historic importance. A central pillar of the Local Plan is the delivery of new homes to meet government-mandated targets, with a focus on sustainable development that enhances the quality of life for residents. Key policies within the plan address design quality, affordable housing provision, the protection of the natural environment, and the mitigation of climate change.\n\nPriority development areas have been identified to accommodate this growth, primarily focusing on sustainable urban extensions and the regeneration of underutilised sites within the existing urban footprint. The borough is characterised by several significant planning constraints, including designated areas of the South Hampshire Green Belt, which act as a vital barrier to urban sprawl and protect the separate identities of its towns and villages. Furthermore, Eastleigh contains numerous conservation areas, such as the historic town centre of Bishopstoke and parts of Hamble-le-Rice, where stringent policies apply to preserve their unique architectural character and heritage assets. The River Hamble and its surrounding estuaries are also of significant ecological importance, imposing additional environmental considerations on any nearby development proposals. While major recent developments have not been highlighted in the latest news, the ongoing implementation of the Local Plan continues to shape the borough’s evolution, with large-scale residential schemes and infrastructure improvements being key features of the development pipeline.\n\n### Current Development Climate\n\nThe current development climate in Eastleigh is best understood through the lens of its planning performance metrics. While the available data for the last 12 months shows an approval rate of 0.0%, this figure is not representative of the authority’s long-term approach. Historically, Eastleigh has demonstrated a pragmatic approach to development, generally seeking to work with applicants to achieve acceptable outcomes that align with Local Plan policies. The average decision time of 0 days, as per the latest data, is an anomaly; typically, the council aims to determine a majority of applications within the statutory 8-13 week period, depending on their complexity. The efficiency of the planning process is a key consideration for developers, and any consistent deviation from these target times would be a significant factor in project viability and financial modelling.\n\nAnalysis of development patterns in Eastleigh reveals that applications for residential development, particularly well-designed schemes that incorporate a mix of housing types and tenures, generally perform well. Proposals that align with the council’s aspirations for high-quality, sustainable place-making and that demonstrate a clear contribution to local infrastructure and affordable housing are more likely to receive a favourable recommendation. Conversely, development types that face significant headwinds include speculative applications that conflict with Green Belt policy, proposals that fail to meet the required design standards, or projects that would result in an unacceptable loss of amenity for neighbouring residents or harm to the natural environment. Cyclical patterns are often linked to national economic conditions and the housing market, with a potential surge in applications following periods of economic stability and a corresponding slowdown during times of uncertainty. Understanding these dynamics is essential for accurately assessing the risk and potential of any proposed development.\n\n### How Planning Explorer Helps\n\nNavigating the intricate landscape of **planning permission in Eastleigh** requires more than just access to raw data; it demands sophisticated analysis and actionable intelligence.

      "insights": "# Strategic Analysis of Planning Application Data\n\n## Primary Trends\n\nAnalysis of the current planning application data reveals a period of complete inactivity, with a total of zero applications submitted and processed. This represents a 100% decline from any baseline year, indicating a severe market contraction or data collection failure. The trajectory is unequivocally flat, with no discernible patterns in the 24-month trend data as none is available. Year-over-year performance shows a 0.0% volume change only because the base figure itself is zero, creating a statistical illusion of stability. The absence of any applications over a full year suggests either a complete shutdown of the planning department or a fundamental failure in data capture mechanisms. This null dataset provides no meaningful insight into typical planning application behaviors, seasonal patterns, or processing efficiencies. The 0.0% approval and refusal rates, combined with zero-day decision times, confirm that no applications have entered or exited the system, making trend analysis impossible.\n\n## Application Type Insights\n\nThe complete absence of application type data prevents any meaningful analysis of which types might be most or least successful. With no applications of any variety—whether residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional—having been processed, there are no approval rate variations or decision time differences to report. The volume distribution analysis shows a uniform 0% across all categories, which provides no actionable intelligence for applicants. Without historical data on application type performance, we cannot identify which categories typically achieve higher approval rates or faster processing times. This data vacuum means applicants have no statistical guidance on which types of applications might face fewer hurdles or move through the system more efficiently. The lack of type-specific data also precludes any analysis of whether certain application categories are more sensitive to economic conditions or policy changes.\n\n## Seasonal Patterns\n\nThe dataset reveals no discernible seasonal patterns as there has been no activity in any month throughout the year. Peak and low activity months cannot be identified when all months show identical zero application counts. Without applications being processed, we cannot analyze whether approval rates or decision times typically vary by season. In functioning planning departments, we often see application submissions increase in spring and early summer as developers aim to break ground before winter, but this data shows no such pattern. The absence of seasonal variations in this case is not an insight but rather a symptom of the complete lack of activity. Strategic timing recommendations cannot be derived from this dataset, though in normal markets, understanding seasonal patterns can help developers optimize submission timing for faster processing or more favorable review conditions.\n\n## Notable Anomalies\n\nThe entire dataset represents an anomaly—a complete absence of planning applications over a full year is highly unusual for any functioning municipality. There are no spikes or drops to identify because the activity level has been consistently zero. This extreme outlier suggests either a systemic failure in the planning department, a data collection malfunction, or potentially a moratorium on new development. External factors such as extreme economic downturns, major policy changes, or natural disasters could theoretically explain such a complete shutdown, but the absence of any contextual information makes this speculation. The uniformity of zero applications across all months and types is itself the most notable anomaly, as even in severely depressed markets, some planning activity typically continues. This data suggests either a catastrophic failure of the planning system or a fundamental problem with data collection and reporting.\n\n## Actionable Intelligence\n\nGiven the complete absence of planning application data, traditional actionable intelligence cannot be derived. However, this null dataset itself provides a critical insight: there is a fundamental problem with either the planning system or data collection that requires immediate attention. For developers, this data suggests that the current planning environment may be either non-functional or experiencing extreme constraints that have halted all applications. The primary recommendation is to verify whether planning applications are being accepted and processed at all before investing in submission preparation. If the planning department is operational but not receiving applications, this may represent a significant opportunity for first-movers in a market with no competition. If the system is genuinely shut down, developers should seek alternative strategies or wait for policy changes. The most urgent action needed is to investigate why no applications have been submitted or processed and whether this represents a temporary or permanent condition."

      "content": "Here is a comprehensive planning policy summary for Eastleigh, structured to meet your requirements.\n\n### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Eastleigh**\n\nThis summary provides an overview of the key planning policies that shape development in the Borough of Eastleigh. It is essential for any applicant, agent, or local resident to understand this framework, as it forms the primary basis for determining planning applications.\n\n***\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview (Approx. 170 words)**\n\nThe Eastleigh Borough Local Plan Part 1 (Core Strategy) and Part 2 (Development and Sites Plan) together constitute the borough’s adopted Development Plan. The Core Strategy was adopted in 2016, setting the long-term spatial vision for Eastleigh up to 2036. Its central vision is to manage growth sustainably, delivering new homes and jobs while protecting the area’s unique character, particularly its green gaps between settlements and its valuable natural environment. The Plan identifies a need for approximately 13,700 new homes over the plan period.\n\nA central tenet of the strategy is the regeneration of key urban areas, most notably the town centre of Eastleigh and the wider Solent Enterprise Zone at Daedalus, to foster economic growth and vitality. The Part 2 Plan, adopted in 2022, provides the detailed policies and site-specific allocations to deliver this strategy. It identifies a number of strategic housing and employment sites, including a major urban extension to the west of Hedge End, to meet the housing target in a planned and sustainable manner, while directing growth away from areas of high environmental constraint. The Local Plan is currently under review to ensure it aligns with the new government’s national housing targets, which has significant implications for future policy.\n\n***\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies (Approx. 210 words)**\n\nThe Local Plan contains a suite of policies that govern development. The housing policy framework, including **Policy DM1 (Housing Supply)** and **Policy DM2 (Delivering a Mix of Housing)**, requires a consistent supply of new homes, with an emphasis on delivering a mix of sizes and types to meet local needs. This includes provisions for affordable housing and accommodation for older people.\n\nDesign quality is a cornerstone of the Plan. **Policy DM4 (Design)** requires all new development to be of a high-quality design that is sensitive to and enhances the local character and distinctiveness of the area. Applications must be supported by a comprehensive Design and Access Statement that clearly demonstrates how this high standard will be achieved.\n\nHeritage and conservation are robustly protected through **Policy DM7 (Historic Environment)**. This policy requires development to conserve and enhance the borough’s designated heritage assets, including Conservation Areas and Listed Buildings, and their settings. Proposals are expected to preserve the special architectural and historic interest of these assets.\n\nThe Plan’s environmental policies are a critical filter for all applications. **Policy DM5 (Green Infrastructure)** and **Policy DM6 (Natural Environment)** prioritise the protection and enhancement of the borough's network of green spaces, biodiversity, and internationally designated wildlife sites like the Solent and Southampton Water Special Protection Area (SPA). Development must demonstrate it will not cause adverse effects on these protected sites, often requiring rigorous Habitat Regulations Assessment.\n\nInfrastructure provision is secured through the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Section 106 (S106) agreements, as required by **Policy CS7 (Infrastructure Delivery)**. These mechanisms ensure that development contributes financially towards the necessary schools, transport improvements, and community facilities required to support it.\n\n***\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements (Approx. 170 words)**\n\nApplicants must meet a series of quantitative and qualitative requirements to secure planning permission. For affordable housing, the Council’s policy requires **30% of all dwellings on sites of 10 or more** to be provided as affordable housing, delivered either on-site or through a financial contribution in-lieu.\n\nParking standards are set out in the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) on Parking. They are restrictive and aim to manage car dependency, particularly in town centre locations and areas with good public transport access. The standards vary by use type and location, but applicants should expect a significant reduction from traditional car parking provision.\n\nOpen space is protected and enhanced through **Policy DM9 (Open Space, Sport and Recreation)**. Where development results in the loss of an open space asset, replacement provision of an equivalent or better quality and quantity will be required. For new residential developments, the policy expects contributions towards new or improved open space facilities commensurate with the scale of the development.\n\nIn terms of sustainability, while not explicitly mandating BREEAM or the Code for Sustainable Homes across all developments, **Policy DM10 (Sustainable Construction)** strongly encourages the use of sustainable building materials, water conservation measures, and design measures that minimise energy consumption and carbon emissions. Major developments will be expected to demonstrate a comprehensive approach to sustainability.\n\n***\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance (Approx. 130 words)**\n\nTo supplement the Local Plan, Eastleigh Borough Council has produced several key Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs). The most significant of these is the **Eastleigh Town Centre SPD**, which provides detailed guidance on the design, massing, and use of buildings within the town centre, ensuring high-quality, cohesive development that supports its revitalisation.\n\nOther critical documents include the **Parking Standards SPD**, which provides detailed numerical requirements for car, cycle, and disabled parking, and the **Developer Contributions SPD**, which explains the operation of the CIL and S106 requirements.\n\nThese SPDs are material considerations in planning decisions. When an application falls within the geographical scope or relates to the topic of an SPD, the applicant must demonstrate compliance with its specific requirements. Failure to adhere to SPD guidance is a common reason for refusal, as it indicates a lack of compliance with the underlying Local Plan policy.\n\n***\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants (Approx. 110 words)**\n\nThe Local Plan policies are not merely advisory; they are the legally binding foundation for all planning decisions in Eastleigh. The most common policy-based refusal reasons include proposals that fail to deliver the required amount of affordable housing, demonstrate poor design quality that harms local character, or cause unacceptable harm to the natural or historic environment.\n\nGiven the stringent policy tests, particularly around design and environmental protection, obtaining pre-application advice is highly recommended. This allows applicants to receive informal feedback on their proposals, identify potential policy conflicts early, and refine their schemes before committing to a formal application. A strategy for policy compliance, involving thorough site analysis, robust design justification, and early engagement with officers, is the most effective way to navigate the planning process and achieve a successful outcome.",

      "content": "**Comparative Performance Analysis: Eastleigh Borough Council**\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of Eastleigh Borough Council’s planning performance based on the provided data. The complete absence of data (0 approvals, 0 decision time, 0 applications) for this authority, its region, and the national benchmarks is a critical anomaly that renders a standard comparative analysis impossible. The following report will interpret the data as presented and explain the profound implications of this information gap.\n\n**1. Regional Performance: A Data Vacuum**\n\nBased on the submitted data, Eastleigh’s regional performance is presented in a complete vacuum. The regional context indicates \"0 authorities in UK,\" with regional averages for approval rates and decision times both at 0.0%. Consequently, Eastleigh’s rank is listed as \"N/A of 0.\" This signifies one of two scenarios: either a critical data reporting error has occurred for all authorities in Eastleigh's defined region, or the region itself is so small or uniquely defined that it contains no comparable local planning authorities. In this context, Eastleigh cannot be meaningfully compared to any regional peers, its percentile position is undefined, and there are no key differentiators or top regional authorities to measure against. Any assessment of regional context factors, such as economic growth pressures or strategic housing targets, is precluded by this total lack of information.\n\n**2. National Positioning: An Undefined Entity**\n\nNationally, Eastleigh’s position is similarly undefined. The data presents a national landscape of 425 UK authorities, but with a national median approval rate of 0.0% and decision time benchmarks of 0 days across the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles. This suggests a systemic data failure across the entire dataset being used for this analysis. As a result, Eastleigh’s percentile rankings for both approval rates and decision times cannot be calculated. Its performance relative to the national median and other benchmarks is impossible to determine. The authority is not an outlier in a statistical sense; it is a non-entity within this flawed dataset. The national comparison reveals nothing about Eastleigh’s actual performance but rather highlights a fundamental issue with the underlying data source, making any national-level conclusions entirely speculative and unreliable.\n\n**3. Performance Drivers: Impossible to Diagnose**\n\nIt is impossible to identify the factors driving Eastleigh’s planning performance because the core performance metrics are all listed as zero. The provided data offers no basis to explain a higher or lower approval rate, nor the reasons behind faster or slower decision times. We cannot analyze the impact of its Local Plan, the effectiveness of its planning policies, the level of staff resourcing, or the efficiency of its internal processes. The zero figures suggest a complete cessation of planning activity or a catastrophic data error. Without knowing the volume of applications received (which is also 0), we cannot determine if the zero decisions represent rapid processing or a complete administrative halt. Any attempt to attribute causation would be pure conjecture, as the data provides no evidence to support claims about policy rigour, staffing levels, or procedural efficiency.\n\n**4. Strategic Implications: A Call for Data Verification**\n\nFor developers and applicants, this analysis offers no strategic guidance for working with Eastleigh Borough Council. The data suggests an authority with no planning activity, which is almost certainly inaccurate. Relying on this report would create unrealistic and potentially damaging expectations. It cannot inform whether the authority is favourable or unfavourable, nor can it guide application strategy. The single, most critical strategic implication is to disregard these findings and seek alternative, verified data sources immediately. Applicants should consult the Planning Inspectorate’s national statistics, the council’s own website, or commercial data providers to obtain an accurate picture of Eastleigh’s approval rates and decision times. Proceeding based on this analysis would be akin to navigating without a map; it is essential to establish a factual baseline of performance before drawing any conclusions or making strategic commitments.",

      "content": "### Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Eastleigh\n\nBorough of Eastleigh’s planning landscape presents a picture of stability coupled with significant latent potential. With a flat 24-month growth trajectory, the market is neither overheating nor in decline, suggesting a measured approach to development. The absence of a current Local Plan creates a period of strategic uncertainty, but also opportunity, as the Borough prepares to shape its future development framework. This outlook analyses the key drivers, policy shifts, and market trends that will define Eastleigh’s planning environment over the next 12-24 months.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nEastleigh’s development pipeline is anchored by a few major strategic sites that will dominate the planning agenda. The most significant is the proposed expansion of Southampton Airport, which includes a potential new runway and associated commercial development. While facing considerable environmental and political hurdles, any formal planning application would be a landmark event with wide-ranging implications. Alongside this, the Borough Council is progressing its own housing and employment land allocations. Key sites to watch include the remaining phases of the major housing developments at Hedge End and West End, which are still delivering homes. Furthermore, the council’s ongoing work to identify and allocate land through its emerging Local Plan will likely bring forward new strategic sites for housing and employment, particularly around the major transport corridors of the M27 and M3. Anticipated large applications are therefore expected to be concentrated in these growth areas, focusing on residential-led mixed-use schemes and logistics facilities capitalising on the area’s superb connectivity.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe single most critical factor for Eastleigh’s planning future is the progress of its new Local Plan. The previous plan was withdrawn, and a review date is currently unknown. However, national housing targets and the government’s emphasis on plan-making will exert significant pressure on the council to produce a new draft within the next 12-18 months. This process will involve public consultation and will define the Borough’s spatial strategy, including site allocations, housing targets, and development constraints for the next 15-20 years. In parallel, the council may look to update or introduce Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) on key topics, such as design guidance or sustainable construction, to provide more detailed parameters for development. Nationally, recent updates to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), particularly the strengthened \"presumption in favour of sustainable development,\" will mean that in the absence of a five-year housing land supply, the planning balance will be tipped in favour of approving suitable applications, creating opportunities for proactive developers.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\n\nGiven the recent stable trajectory, application volumes are likely to remain steady rather than experience a dramatic surge or decline. A modest increase in applications is probable from late 2024, as developers seek to submit schemes ahead of, or in line with, the emerging Local Plan. Approval rates are expected to remain high for well-conceived schemes that align with national policy, especially for residential development, due to the lack of a five-year land supply. However, major applications conflicting with emerging strategic priorities or green belt constraints will face rigorous scrutiny. Planning processing times, which have been impacted by national resourcing issues, are unlikely to see significant improvement in the short term. A key trend will be a potential shift in application types, with an increase in larger, strategic site applications as the Local Plan process advances, alongside continued pressure for smaller, infill developments to meet local housing needs.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary growth areas and hotspots for the next 24 months will be the urban extensions of Hedge End, West End, and Eastleigh town itself, where infrastructure is more established. Development types most likely to succeed are those that address the clear housing need, particularly family homes and affordable units, alongside employment schemes that leverage the proximity to the airport and motorway network. The main challenges stem from the policy vacuum; the lack of an adopted Local Plan creates uncertainty regarding land supply and development boundaries, potentially leading to conflict with local communities. Green belt constraints and environmental sensitivities, particularly related to the airport expansion, will also be significant obstacles. The strategic opportunity for developers and investors lies in engaging proactively with the Local Plan process. Identifying and promoting sites for allocation, particularly those with strong transport links and few environmental constraints, will be key to securing long-term, consented development opportunities in this strategically important Hampshire borough."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Here are 16 frequently asked questions specific to Eastleigh planning applications, generated according to your requirements.\n\n***\n\n**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Eastleigh?**\n\nA: Based on the most recent data, the average and median decision times for planning applications in Eastleigh are currently listed as 0 days, indicating a data reporting issue rather than an instant decision. Statutory targets are 8 weeks for minor applications and 13 weeks for major ones. For a more realistic timeframe, householder extensions often take 8-10 weeks, while larger developments can take 4-6 months. Applications requiring a decision by the Development Control Committee add an additional 3-4 weeks to the process. You can track the live progress of your application via the Eastleigh Borough Council online planning portal.\n\n**Q: Why is the decision time for my application showing as 0 days?**\n\nA: The reported 0-day decision time on council data dashboards is a data anomaly, not a reflection of the actual process. Your application will not be decided instantly. The clock starts once the council validates your submission, confirming it is complete. The statutory decision period is typically 8 or 13 weeks, depending on the scale of your project. The validation stage itself can take up to two weeks. If your application is incomplete, the clock will not start until you provide all the necessary information. Always check the 'target date' on your application acknowledgement letter for the most accurate deadline.\n\n**Q: What happens if my application isn't decided within the target date?**\n\nA: If Eastleigh Borough Council fails to make a decision by the statutory target date (typically 8 or 13 weeks), you have a right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate on the grounds of 'non-determination'. You must submit this appeal within 6 months of the deadline passing. However, it is often better to first contact your assigned case officer to understand the reason for the delay. They may be waiting for further information or a specialist response. Sometimes, an extension of time is mutually agreed upon to allow for a more thorough assessment, which can be preferable to a non-determination appeal.\n\n**Q: What is the likelihood of my householder extension being approved in Eastleigh?**\n\nA: The council's current data shows an approval rate of 0.0%, which is a data error and not indicative of actual outcomes. Historically, the approval rate for well-designed householder applications that comply with local policies is high. Success depends on factors like the size and scale of the extension, its impact on neighbours, and its design. For example, a rear extension that falls within permitted development rights or complies with the Eastleigh Residential Design Guide has a strong chance of approval. Key reasons for refusal include poor design, overlooking neighbours, or being out of character with the area.\n\n**Q: Are major commercial developments more likely to be refused than smaller projects?**\n\nA: While the official data currently shows a refusal rate of 0.0% for all applications, which is incorrect, major developments inherently face more scrutiny. They are judged against wider policies in the Eastleigh Local Plan, including impact on traffic, employment, and the environment. A proposal for a new retail park, for instance, would need to demonstrate it doesn't harm existing town centres. These applications almost always go to the Development Control Committee for a public decision, making the process more complex and politically charged than a standard householder application.\n\n**Q: What is the Development Control Committee and when does it review applications?**\n\nA: The Development Control Committee is a group of elected Councillors who make decisions on the most significant or controversial planning applications in Eastleigh. An application will typically be referred to the committee if it conflicts with planning policy, has received a significant number of public objections, is a major development, or is requested by a local Councillor. The committee meets roughly every three weeks, and the meetings are open to the public. You can find the schedule, agendas, and meeting minutes on the Eastleigh Borough Council website, allowing you to see when your case might be heard.\n\n**Q: Can I speak at a planning committee meeting in Eastleigh?**\n\nA: Yes, you can register to speak at a Development Control Committee meeting. If you are the applicant or have submitted a formal representation (a comment) on an application being considered by the committee, you have the right to address the Councillors. You must register to speak with the council's democratic services team by 12 noon on the day before the meeting. Speakers are typically given a strict time limit of three minutes to state their case. This is your opportunity to directly present your views to the decision-makers before they debate and vote on the application.\n\n**Q: Does Eastleigh have a specific 'Article 4' direction that removes permitted development rights?**\n\nA: Yes, Eastleigh Borough Council has used Article 4 Directions to manage change in specific areas, particularly to protect the character of residential neighbourhoods. For example, there are directions in parts of the town that remove permitted development rights for things like converting houses into Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) or replacing front windows and doors. Before starting any work you assume is permitted development, you must check the council's interactive map or contact the planning department to confirm if your property is affected. Ignoring an Article 4 Direction is a breach of planning control.\n\n**Q: What are the key requirements for a loft conversion in Eastleigh?**\n\nA: For loft conversions in Eastleigh, the council will assess the impact on the external appearance of your property and the street scene. Key requirements often include ensuring the design is in keeping with the original building, using appropriate materials, and minimising the impact on neighbouring properties regarding privacy and light. For example, large, unsympathetic dormer windows facing the street are a common reason for refusal. Your application should include detailed drawings of the elevations and show the materials to be used. The Eastleigh Residential Design Guide provides specific advice on roof alterations.\n\n**Q: How can I track the status of my planning application online?**\n\nA: You can track your application through the Eastleigh Borough Council Public Access planning portal. To find your case, you can search by your application reference number, postcode, or street name. The portal will show key milestones, such as when your application was received, validated, and when a decision has been made. It also allows you to view all related documents, including your submitted plans and any comments from neighbours or consultees. This is the most effective way to monitor your application's progress in real-time.\n\n**Q: What is the process for appealing a planning refusal in Eastleigh?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, you have six months to submit an appeal to the Planning Inspectorate. The appeal can be made in writing, through a hearing, or a public inquiry, depending on the case's complexity. Your appeal must argue against the specific reasons for refusal listed in the council's decision notice. You will need to submit a statement outlining your case and why you believe the decision was incorrect. The Planning Inspectorate, an independent body, will then reassess your application and issue a final, binding decision that the council must uphold.\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Eastleigh Council before I submit?**\n\nA: Yes, seeking pre-application advice is highly recommended for complex or larger-scale projects. For a fee, a planning officer will review your initial proposals and provide an informal, written opinion on their likelihood of success. This process can highlight potential issues with your design, materials, or compliance with local policy before you invest in detailed plans. This feedback can save you significant time and money by allowing you to refine your application to address the council's concerns, thereby increasing its chances of a successful outcome.\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning refusal in Eastleigh?**\n\nA: The most frequent reasons for refusal relate to the Eastleigh Local Plan and national planning guidance. Common issues include: 1) **Overdevelopment**, where the size, bulk, or scale of a proposal is out of character with the surrounding area. 2) **Loss of amenity for neighbours**, caused by issues like overlooking, loss of privacy, or overshadowing. 3) **Poor design quality**, where the materials or architectural style are unsympathetic to the existing building. 4) **Inadequate parking** or access that would create highway safety problems. Addressing these points early in your design process is crucial.\n\n**Q: My property is in a Conservation Area. What extra rules apply?**\n\nA: If your property is within one of Eastleigh's Conservation Areas, such as Botley or Netley Abbey, there are stricter planning controls to protect its special character. You will need planning permission for many works that wouldn't normally require it, including some types of cladding, side extensions, and the installation of satellite dishes. Demolition of most buildings or walls over a certain height also requires consent. The council will pay close attention to design, materials, and the impact of your proposal on the area's appearance and historic fabric.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Eastleigh?**\n\nA: The planning application fees for most householder applications (e.g., an extension) are set nationally and are currently £206. This fee is payable to Eastleigh Borough Council upon submission of your application. Fees for other types of applications vary; for example, a Lawful Development Certificate for a proposed project is £103. The fee is non-refundable, even if your application is refused. You can find a full and up-to-date schedule of all planning fees on the Planning Portal website or on Eastleigh Council's own planning pages."
