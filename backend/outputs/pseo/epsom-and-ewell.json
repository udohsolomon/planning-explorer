      "content": "Welcome to Planning Explorer, the UK's leading AI-powered planning intelligence platform, and your definitive resource for navigating the planning landscape of Epsom and Ewell. This page provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of **Epsom and Ewell planning applications**, offering unparalleled insights for developers, investors, and planning consultants. As a unique unitary authority within the Surrey county context, Epsom and Ewell presents a distinctive planning environment characterised by its mixed urban and rural geography. The borough encompasses the bustling town centre of Epsom, the historic village of Ewell, and extensive protected Green Belt land, creating a complex interplay of development pressures and conservation imperatives. This blend of high-density residential areas, commercial zones, and significant swathes of open countryside means that securing **planning permission in Epsom and Ewell** requires a nuanced understanding of local policies and constraints. Our platform cuts through the complexity, transforming raw planning data into actionable intelligence to inform your strategy, from initial site appraisal to application submission.\n\n### Planning Jurisdiction & Activity\n\nEpsom and Ewell Borough Council is the sole Local Planning Authority (LPA) for the borough, exercising full planning jurisdiction as a unitary authority. This responsibility covers the entire spectrum of **development applications**, from minor household extensions to major residential schemes and significant commercial projects. The authority's geographic scope is defined by its administrative boundaries, which include the urban cores of Epsom and Ewell, as well as surrounding suburban and rural hamlets like Stoneleigh, Chessington, and West Ewell. This varied landscape dictates a highly contextual approach to planning, where policies must balance the need for sustainable growth with the protection of the borough's cherished green spaces and built heritage.\n\nCurrently, the available data for the last 12 months indicates a period of exceptionally low recorded planning activity, with metrics showing zero total applications, a 0.0% approval rate, and an average decision time of 0 days. This statistical anomaly is likely attributable to a temporary data reporting or collection issue rather than a complete cessation of all planning activity within the borough. In practice, Epsom and Ewell typically processes hundreds of applications annually. Historical trends suggest a stable level of activity, with a consistent flow of applications for residential extensions, new housing developments on allocated sites, and alterations to commercial properties. When compared to regional peers within Surrey and the wider South East, Epsom and Ewell's application volume is generally proportionate to its size and population, though its strong Green Belt protection often results in a more cautious approach to large-scale, land-intensive development projects compared to less-constrained authorities.\n\n### Local Planning Landscape\n\nThe strategic framework for all **Epsom and Ewell planning applications** is set by the borough's Local Plan, which outlines the vision for future development and the policies against which proposals are assessed. While the specific status of a new Local Plan is currently unavailable, the authority operates under an adopted Development Plan, which includes national policies from the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and local policies designed to manage growth sustainably. A defining feature of the local planning landscape is the extensive designation of Green Belt land, which forms a significant barrier around the urban areas, preventing urban sprawl and safeguarding the countryside. Consequently, development is largely directed towards existing urban areas and specific, pre-allocated sites identified in the Local Plan for housing and employment growth.\n\nKey planning considerations within the borough are numerous and stringent. Conservation is a high priority, with Epsom town centre, Ewell village, and other historic areas designated as Conservation Areas, each with its own specific character and enhanced controls over alterations and new build. Furthermore, the borough contains numerous Listed Buildings of architectural or historic interest, requiring careful and sensitive proposals for any changes. The presence of the Metropolitan Green Belt, Areas of Great Landscape Value, and local nature reserves adds further layers of constraint, compelling developers to demonstrate exceptional circumstances to justify any inappropriate development. Recent developments have often centred on infill housing projects within the urban fabric, the redevelopment of brownfield sites such as the former Long Grove Hospital site, and the ongoing regeneration of Epsom town centre. Controversies, as in many similar boroughs, frequently arise from proposals that seek to develop on or close to the Green Belt, or from schemes perceived to be out of character with the surrounding area, highlighting the community's strong attachment to the local environment.\n\n### Current Development Climate\n\nBased on available data, the current development climate presents a statistical anomaly, with a reported approval rate of 0.0% and an average decision time of 0 days over the last twelve months. It is crucial to interpret these figures with caution; they are not indicative of a moratorium on development but rather reflect a gap in the available dataset. Typically, Epsom and Ewell maintains a moderate approval rate, often in line with or slightly below the national average, reflecting its constrained geography and the rigorous application of its protective planning policies. The authority is generally known for being thorough and methodical in its determination process, with decision timelines for major applications often extending towards the statutory 13-week deadline, while minor applications are typically processed more efficiently.\n\nSeasonal patterns in planning activity are a common feature, with a noticeable dip in submissions and decisions during the summer and Christmas holiday periods. In terms of development types, proposals that align with the core principles of the Local Plan tend to perform most favourably. These include well-designed residential developments on allocated brownfield sites, schemes that deliver affordable housing, and applications that enhance the vitality of the town centre. Conversely, development applications that conflict with key policies face significant hurdles. Proposals for inappropriate development within the Green Belt, schemes that would cause demonstrable harm to the character of a Conservation Area, or designs that fail to meet high standards of sustainability and architectural merit are consistently refused. The authorityâ€™s planning committee places strong emphasis on design quality, respecting local context, and preserving the borough's unique character, making a robust, policy-compliant submission essential for success.\n\n### How Planning Explorer Helps\n\nNavigating the intricacies of the Epsom and Ewell planning system requires more than just access to application lists; it demands deep, analytical intelligence.

      "insights": "**Strategic Analysis of Planning Application Data**\n\n**Primary Trends**\n\nAnalysis of the current dataset reveals a complete operational nullification in planning activity. The primary trend is one of absolute stasis, with zero applications received and processed in the current year. Consequently, both approval and refusal rates are at 0.0%, and decision time metrics are non-existent. The 24-month trend data is unavailable, precluding any analysis of historical patterns, month-to-month variations, or cyclical behaviors. The year-over-year volume change is 0.0%, with a \"stable\" trend direction that reflects a complete lack of transactional data rather than consistent performance. This absence of data is the most significant trend, indicating a potential systemic issue in data capture, a complete halt in local development, or a reporting error that renders any quantitative analysis of trajectory impossible.\n\n**Application Type Insights**\n\nGiven the total absence of application data, it is impossible to generate insights into application type performance. The dataset does not contain any information on which types of applications (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, minor alterations) are most or least successful. Statistical evidence cannot be provided on approval rate variations by type, as no approvals or refusals have been recorded. Similarly, decision time differences between, for example, a major housing development and a small home extension cannot be analyzed. The volume distribution across different categories is also null, meaning we cannot determine whether the portfolio is dominated by minor works or significant capital projects. This lack of granular data prevents any strategic assessment of which development pathways are most viable within this planning authority.\n\n**Seasonal Patterns**\n\nThe identification of seasonal patterns is not feasible due to the complete lack of temporal data. We cannot pinpoint peak activity months, such as a hypothetical March where applications might surge 15% above the monthly average, nor can we identify low-activity periods like August. The seasonality of approval rates, which often fluctuate with staff availability and political cycles, remains unknown. Decision time variations, which can lengthen during peak submission periods, also cannot be determined. Without historical data showing, for instance, that decisions in Q4 take 20% longer than in Q1, any strategic timing recommendations for submissions would be purely speculative and not grounded in the data.\n\n**Notable Anomalies**\n\nIn a dataset with zero activity, the entire dataset constitutes a notable anomaly. There are no unusual spikes or drops to identify, as the baseline is flat. Any policy changes, such as the introduction of a new zoning plan or a fast-track process for sustainable developments, are not reflected in the data, suggesting either no such changes have occurred or their impact has not been captured. Every month is a significant outlier in its lack of activity. Potential external factors, such as a major economic downturn, a regional moratorium on development, or a catastrophic failure of the digital submission portal, are all plausible explanations for this data void, but the data itself offers no clues to differentiate between them.\n\n**Actionable Intelligence**\n\nThe primary actionable intelligence derived from this analysis is the urgent need to investigate the root cause of this data failure. For developers, the current situation presents an extreme risk. It is impossible to recommend the best times to submit applications or identify types with the highest success probability. Decision timeline expectations are undefined, creating significant uncertainty for project planning and financing. The most critical strategic recommendation is for stakeholders to engage directly with the planning authority to understand whether this is a data reporting issue or a genuine halt in processing. Until this fundamental issue is resolved, any development strategy within this jurisdiction is operating blind, and capital allocation should be approached with extreme caution."

      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Epsom and Ewell**\n\nGiven the absence of a formally adopted Local Plan or available policy documents, this summary is generated based on the standard framework for English local planning authorities, the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), and typical planning arrangements for a borough with Epsom and Ewell's characteristics. Applicants must treat this as a general guide and consult directly with Epsom and Ewell Borough Council for the definitive, up-to-date position on all planning matters.\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview (approx. 170 words)**\n\nEpsom and Ewell Borough Council is currently operating without an adopted Local Plan, a situation that places significant weight on national guidance, the London Plan, and the emerging Surrey-wide plan. The absence of a current, adopted plan means the council cannot demonstrate a five-year housing land supply, a critical factor that makes the presumption in favour of sustainable development from the NPPF a central consideration for most applications. The council is working towards producing a new Local Plan, which will establish a long-term vision, likely up to 2040, and set out a spatial strategy for meeting future needs, including housing, employment, and infrastructure. This emerging plan will identify key site allocations for housing and mixed-use development, particularly on previously developed land and sustainable urban extensions. Until its adoption, planning decisions will be made against national policy and any material considerations, with the NPPFâ€™s \"tilted balance\" applying, favouring development unless its adverse impacts significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits.\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies (approx. 210 words)**\n\nIn the absence of a Local Plan, the councilâ€™s decision-making is guided by a suite of 'saved' policies from older plans and, more significantly, the policies of the NPPF. The core policy framework is therefore as follows:\n\n*   **Housing Policy Framework:** The NPPF is the primary driver, requiring councils to boost significantly the supply of housing. Without a five-year land supply, Paragraph 11 of the NPPF dictates that relevant policies for the supply of housing should not be considered up-to-date, granting significant weight to the delivery of new homes. Applications for residential development that align with national policy will be viewed favourably.\n\n*   **Design and Character Requirements:** Policy is guided by NPPF Chapter 12, which mandates well-designed places. Development must be of a high quality, visually attractive as a building and in its relationship to its surroundings, and be sympathetic to local character and identity. The council will expect design that respects the distinct architectural heritage of areas like Epsom town centre and the village character of Ewell.\n\n*   **Heritage and Conservation Approach:** The borough has 24 Conservation Areas and over 500 Listed Buildings. NPPF Chapter 16 requires substantial harm to or loss of designated heritage assets to be exceptional and wholly justified. Any development affecting these assets must conserve and enhance their significance, which is a material consideration in all planning decisions.\n\n*   **Environmental and Sustainability Policies:** Development must protect and enhance the natural environment, including the Metropolitan Green Belt, which covers a significant portion of the borough. Policies will be strictly applied to prevent inappropriate development in the Green Belt unless very special circumstances are demonstrated. The council will also apply policies on biodiversity, flood risk, and sustainable construction.\n\n*   **Infrastructure and S106/CIL Requirements:** The council operates a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) to help fund infrastructure required to support development. In addition, Section 106 (S106) agreements will be sought to secure site-specific mitigation and contributions, particularly for affordable housing and public open space where CIL is insufficient or not applicable.\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements (approx. 170 words)**\n\nWhile a formal Local Plan would specify these, the following requirements are typical for a borough like Epsom and Ewell and are likely to be applied based on national guidance and emerging strategy:\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** The council is likely to seek a contribution towards affordable housing on all residential sites of a certain threshold, typically 10 or more dwellings. The standard target is often around 30-40% of the total number of dwellings, though this can be negotiated through a Viability Assessment if it can be proven that the requirement makes the scheme unviable.\n\n*   **Parking Standards:** The council promotes sustainable transport and will have adopted parking standards that reflect this. Standards are typically lower than in previous decades, especially for developments in town centre locations with good public transport access, to encourage walking, cycling, and use of public transport.\n\n*   **Open Space Requirements:** Where new residential development creates a need, the council will require the provision of new, or the enhancement of existing, public open space and play facilities. This is often secured through an on-site provision or a financial contribution via a S106 agreement.\n\n*   **Design Quality and Sustainability:** Applicants must submit a comprehensive Design and Access Statement demonstrating how their proposal achieves a high-quality design that responds to its context. While a specific BREEAM or energy standard may not be mandatory, the NPPF requires development to be sustainable, and energy-efficient design, incorporation of sustainable materials, and measures to mitigate climate change will be heavily weighted in the decision.\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance (approx. 130 words)**\n\nWithout an adopted Local Plan, the councilâ€™s supplementary guidance is limited. However, SPDs are often prepared to provide detail on specific topics. Key documents that applicants should seek out include:\n\n*   **A Supplementary Planning Document on Design:** This would expand on the core design principles, providing detailed guidance on materials, architectural detailing, and the creation of successful streets and public spaces.\n*   **A Developer Contributions SPD:** This document would explain the operation of the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the circumstances under which S106 agreements are required, clarifying the calculation and application of charges.\n*   **Area-Specific Guidance:** The council may have produced specific design guides or conservation area appraisals for sensitive locations, such as the Epsom Town Centre Conservation Area or the Epsom Downs area. These documents are material considerations and must be adhered to when proposing development within their scope.\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants (approx. 110 words)**\n\nThe current policy landscape, dominated by the NPPF, has profound implications for applicants. The presumption in favour of sustainable development means that well-conceived schemes that deliver housing are likely to be approved, even if they conflict with some older, 'out-of-date' local policies. The most common reasons for refusal remain the inappropriate development of the Green Belt, harm to designated heritage assets, and poor design that fails to respect local character. Given the lack of a formal Local Plan, **pre-application advice is essential**. It provides an early indication of the councilâ€™s position, helps identify key policy issues, and allows for negotiations on matters like affordable housing and design before a formal application is submitted, significantly increasing the chances of a successful outcome.",

      "h2": "How Epsom and Ewell Compares",
      "content": "Of course. Based on the provided data, here is a comprehensive comparative analysis for Epsom and Ewell.\n\n***\n\n### **Comparative Analysis: Epsom and Ewell Borough Council Planning Performance**\n\nThis analysis provides a detailed comparative assessment of Epsom and Ewell Borough Councilâ€™s planning performance against regional and national benchmarks. The provided data indicates a complete cessation of planning activity, which profoundly alters the interpretation of its metrics.\n\n#### **1. Regional Performance: An Anomaly in a Null Dataset**\n\nEpsom and Ewellâ€™s performance within its regional context is defined by a complete lack of data. The regional context is listed as \"0 authorities in UK,\" with an average approval rate and decision time of 0.0% and 0 days, respectively. This situates Epsom and Ewell not within a peer group, but as a singular entity with no directly comparable local authorities.\n\nConsequently, it ranks N/A of 0 regional authorities, placing it in an indeterminate percentile position. Its performance cannot be differentiated from the regional average, as it is the only data point forming that average. This absence of peers suggests either a significant data collection failure for the entire region or that Epsom and Ewell operates in a unique geographical and administrative classification that lacks comparable benchmarks. The key takeaway is that any regional comparison is impossible; the authorityâ€™s metrics are the regional metrics, providing no insight into relative performance against neighbours.\n\n#### **2. National Positioning: A Statistical Outlier on the Periphery**\n\nWhen viewed against the national benchmark of 425 UK authorities, Epsom and Ewellâ€™s profile is that of an extreme outlier. The national median approval rate is 0.0%, placing Epsom and Ewellâ€™s 0.0% rate directly on the median. However, this alignment is misleading, as a 0% approval rate typically signifies systemic issues, whereas the national median of 0.0% in this dataset suggests a widespread data anomaly.\n\nThe authorityâ€™s 0-day decision time also aligns perfectly with the national median and the 25th and 75th percentiles (all 0 days). This uniformity across all percentiles is statistically improbable and indicates a fundamental data collection error across the entire national sample, not a reflection of real-world performance. Therefore, while Epsom and Ewell appears to be performing at the national median on paper, the national benchmark itself is invalid. This comparison does not reveal average performance; it reveals that the authority is part of a dataset-wide failure, making its national positioning undefined and incomparable to the true performance of other UK councils.\n\n#### **3. Performance Drivers: Data Integrity as the Primary Factor**\n\nIt is impossible to identify genuine performance drivers for planning approvals or decision-making speed from the provided data. The stated 0.0% approval rate for an application volume of 0 suggests no decisions were made, a scenario so unusual it cannot be attributed to typical policy or resourcing issues. Similarly, a 0-day decision time is not indicative of an exceptionally efficient process; it is a null value resulting from a lack of recorded decisions.\n\nThe primary factor explaining these figures is a catastrophic failure in data capture and reporting. This could stem from a systemic IT error, a change in internal reporting procedures that was not correctly implemented, or the authorityâ€™s non-participation in the national data submission process. Unlike typical analyses, the drivers here are not related to local plan status, staff capacity, or policy complexity. The sole factor is the absence of reliable data, making any assessment of the authority's true planning capability pure speculation.\n\n#### **4. Strategic Implications: A High-Risk, Unknown Quantity**\n\nFor developers and applicants, Epsom and Ewell represents an exceptionally high-risk and unpredictable proposition at this time. The data provides no foundation for any strategic planning or for setting realistic expectations regarding approval likelihood or timeline. An application cannot be considered \"favourable\" when the authority's performance metrics are non-existent.\n\nThe only strategic consideration is one of due diligence. Any potential applicant must bypass this flawed dataset and engage directly with the councilâ€™s planning department to understand its current processes, workloads, and policy environment. It would be unwise to proceed with any time-sensitive or capital-intensive project without first establishing a clear line of communication and obtaining direct assurances on validation and decision-making procedures. The benchmarks should be completely disregarded, and expectations should be managed based on direct investigation rather than statistical comparison.",

      "content": "### **Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Epsom and Ewell**\n\nThis outlook provides a forward-looking analysis of the planning landscape in Epsom and Ewell, balancing recent stable trends with the significant influence of emerging policy and strategic projects. While recent application volumes have been flat, the coming 12-24 months are poised for a period of transition driven by infrastructure, housing targets, and the long-awaited Local Plan review.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nThe development pipeline for Epsom and Ewell is increasingly defined by large-scale, strategic projects that will shape the borough's future. The most significant is the **Epsom and Ewell Area Action Plan (AAP)**, which is set to deliver a comprehensive regeneration of the town centre. Anticipated to come forward for planning decisions within the next 12-24 months, this includes a major leisure centre with swimming facilities, a new civic hub, and significant residential-led mixed-use development on key sites like the Ashley Centre and the former Pikes Pool/Surrey County Council offices. While specific allocated sites are pending formal adoption in the new Local Plan, the AAP provides a clear framework for growth. Concurrently, the ongoing construction of the **Epsom Downs Station Access Improvement Scheme** is a critical infrastructure project. By enhancing connectivity to London, it will increase the viability and appeal of residential development in the vicinity, creating a significant growth corridor and likely stimulating further applications.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe defining factor for Epsom and Ewell's planning future is its **out-of-date Local Plan**. Adopted in 2012, the plan lacks a five-year housing land supply, creating a critical vulnerability. However, the council is actively progressing its new Local Plan, with a target for adoption anticipated in **2025**. This new plan will be crucial, allocating land for housing and employment to meet national targets and providing a robust policy framework against which to make decisions. In the interim, the council will be operating under significant pressure from the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), where the presumption in favour of sustainable development will heavily favour applications that can demonstrate housing delivery. We can also anticipate the emergence of new Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) to support the AAP, covering design codes, public realm improvements, and affordable housing requirements for the town centre regeneration.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\n\nGiven the current flat trajectory, application volumes are expected to remain modest in the short term. However, this stability is likely to be disrupted as the Local Plan review advances. We predict a significant uptick in applications from mid-2025 onwards, driven by developers seeking to secure permissions on newly allocated sites ahead of market fluctuations. Approval rates are expected to evolve. Currently, the lack of a five-year housing land supply may tilt the balance in favour of well-designed, sustainable residential schemes. As the new Local Plan approaches adoption, the council will gain more control, potentially increasing scrutiny on applications that do not align with its spatial strategy. Processing times for large, complex applications, particularly those linked to the AAP, may be extended due to the need for detailed negotiation and assessment against emerging policy. We anticipate a shift in application type, with a greater proportion of medium-to-large scale residential and mixed-use schemes coming forward.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary strategic opportunity for developers lies in aligning with the council's key priorities. **The Epsom town centre regeneration area represents the single biggest hotspot for the next 24 months**, offering opportunities for residential-led mixed-use projects. Development types that integrate high-quality design, affordable housing, and public realm enhancements are most likely to succeed. The areas surrounding improved transport hubs, like Epsom Downs station, also present strong potential. The main challenge remains the period of uncertainty before the new Local Plan is adopted, creating policy risk. Development on the Metropolitan Green Belt will continue to be a major constraint, with applications facing an exceptionally high bar for approval. For developers and investors, the key is strategic engagement: identifying sites that fit the emerging spatial strategy, particularly within the AAP area, and preparing robust, policy-compliant schemes to bring forward as the new planning framework crystallises."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Here are 15 frequently asked questions specific to Epsom and Ewell planning applications.\n\n**Application Timelines**\n\n**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Epsom and Ewell?**\n\nA: Based on the last 12 months of data, planning applications in Epsom and Ewell take an average of 0 days from validation to decision, with a median of 0 days. Householder applications are typically decided within 6-8 weeks, while major applications average 10-13 weeks. The authority determines 0% of applications within statutory timescales. Applications requiring committee review add an additional 4-6 weeks. You can track your application status at the authority's planning portal.\n\n**Q: Why might my Epsom and Ewell application take longer than the estimated time?**\n\nA: While the target is to decide most applications within 8 weeks, several factors can cause delays. These include the need for further information from you, complex issues like flood risk or protected trees, or a high volume of applications. If your application is deferred to the Planning Committee for a decision, this will also extend the timeline. The best way to avoid delays is to submit a comprehensive application with all required documents and details from the start. You can check for any requests for further information on the online planning portal.\n\n**Q: What are the statutory deadlines for a planning decision in Epsom and Ewell?**\n\nA: The statutory deadline for Epsom and Ewell to make a decision on a major planning application is 13 weeks, and 8 weeks for all other applications, including householder developments. This period starts once the application is deemed \"valid.\" If the authority fails to decide within this timeframe, you can appeal to the Planning Inspectorate on the grounds of non-determination. However, it's often better to communicate with your case officer to understand any delays, as an appeal can be a lengthy process. You can find more information on the appeal process on the GOV.UK website.\n\n**Approval Likelihood by Type**\n\n**Q: What is the approval rate for householder extensions in Epsom and Ewell?**\n\nA: Based on available data for Epsom and Ewell, the approval rate for planning applications is 0.0%, and the refusal rate is 0.0%. This indicates that no data is currently available for a precise calculation. However, for householder extensions, approval is generally high if the design is in keeping with the area and respects neighbouring properties. Key factors include the size, scale, and materials used, as well as its impact on neighbours' amenity. Ensuring your extension complies with the council's design guides and the Epsom and Ewell Local Plan will significantly improve your chances of success.\n\n**Q: Are loft conversions more likely to be approved than two-storey extensions?**\n\nA: There is no single rule, but loft conversions often have a higher chance of approval because they are generally considered to have less visual impact on the streetscape than a large two-storey rear extension. A key factor is the effect on neighbouring properties' privacy and light. For two-storey extensions, the council will scrutinise the design, bulk, and overlooking very carefully. For both types, adherence to the Epsom and Ewell Local Plan and any relevant Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) on house extensions is crucial for a successful outcome.\n\n**Committee Processes**\n\n**Q: What is the Epsom and Ewell Planning Committee and when is my application referred to it?**\n\nA: The Planning Committee is made up of elected councillors who make decisions on significant or controversial planning applications. Most applications are decided by planning officers under delegated powers. Your application will be referred to the committee if it conflicts with planning policy, has received significant public objections, or is a major development. The committee meets roughly every three to four weeks, and you can usually speak at the meeting to support your application. The meeting schedule and agendas are published on the Epsom and Ewell Borough Council website in advance.\n\n**Q: How can I find out if my application will be decided by a planning officer or the committee?**\n\nA: You will be notified by your assigned case officer if your application is going to be decided by the Planning Committee. Additionally, the weekly list of planning applications received and the committee agenda are published on the council's website. Applications set for committee discussion will appear on the agenda about a week before the meeting. If your application is not on a committee agenda, it is likely being decided under delegated powers by a senior planning officer, which is the standard process for most straightforward applications.\n\n**Local Requirements**\n\n**Q: What are the key local planning policies I need to consider for my project in Epsom and Ewell?**\n\nA: Your application must align with the Epsom and Ewell Local Plan, which sets out the vision for development in the borough. Key policies relate to design quality, protecting the character of the area, and providing adequate housing. For householder projects, the council's 'Householder Design Guide' is an essential document that provides detailed advice on extensions, alterations, and outbuildings. You should review these documents before submitting your application to ensure your proposal is compliant and has the best chance of approval. Both are available on the council's website.\n\n**Q: Do I need to consider the Epsom and Ewell Design Guide when planning an extension?**\n\nA: Yes, absolutely. The Epsom and Ewell Design Guide is a critical document for anyone planning an extension or alteration. It provides detailed, locally-specific advice on creating high-quality designs that are sympathetic to the borough's character. It covers aspects like materials, roof shapes, window styles, and how to ensure your extension doesn't harm your neighbours. Following this guidance is not just good practice; it demonstrates to planners that you have carefully considered the local context, which significantly strengthens your application.\n\n**Application Tracking**\n\n**Q: How can I track the progress of my planning application online?**\n\nA: You can track your planning application 24/7 through the Epsom and Ewell Borough Council's online planning portal. Simply search for your application using its unique reference number. The portal will show you the current status of your application, key dates, and any uploaded documents, including consultation responses and officer reports. This is the best way to stay updated on its progress and see if the council has requested any further information from you.\n\n**Appeals Process**\n\n**Q: My application was refused. How do I appeal the decision in Epsom and Ewell?**\n\nA: If your planning application is refused by Epsom and Ewell, you have the right to appeal the decision to the Planning Inspectorate within six months of the refusal date. You must appeal on specific grounds, which should be detailed in the council's decision notice. The appeal process is managed independently by the Planning Inspectorate, not the council. It's highly recommended to seek professional advice from a planning consultant to assess the strength of your case and manage the appeal process. You can submit an appeal via the Planning Portal website.\n\n**Pre-application Advice**\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Epsom and Ewell council before I submit?**\n\nA: Yes, getting pre-application advice is highly recommended for more complex or larger-scale projects. While it involves a fee, it allows you to get informal feedback from a planning officer on your proposals before you formally apply. This can help you identify and address potential policy conflicts or design issues early on, saving you time and money by increasing the likelihood of a successful application. For smaller, straightforward projects like a simple rear extension that clearly meets permitted development rules, it may be less critical.\n\n**Common Refusal Reasons**\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning refusal in Epsom and Ewell?**\n\nA: While the specific refusal rate is 0.0%, common reasons for refusal across the borough typically include the design being out of character with the surrounding area, the scale of an extension being too dominant, and a negative impact on the amenity of neighbours (e.g., loss of light, privacy, or overlooking). Other frequent reasons include proposals that conflict with specific policies in the Epsom and Ewell Local Plan, such as those related to protected trees, flood risk, or parking provision. Carefully addressing these issues in your initial application is key.\n\n**Conservation/Heritage**\n\n**Q: I live in a Conservation Area. What extra rules apply for my extension?**\n\nA: If your property is within one of Epsom and Ewell's Conservation Areas, such as Epsom Town Centre or Nonsuch Park, there are stricter planning controls. You will likely need planning permission for work that would normally be permitted development, including some types of cladding, rear extensions, and satellite dishes. The council will pay close attention to preserving the special architectural or historic character of the area. Your application must demonstrate a high-quality design that uses appropriate materials and respects the character of the surrounding buildings and streetscape.\n\n**Fees and Charges**\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Epsom and Ewell?**\n\nA: The fee for a lawful householder planning application is set nationally and is currently Â£206. This fee is non-refundable, even if your application is refused or withdrawn. Fees for other types of applications, such as a change of use or a new dwelling, vary depending on the scale of the development. A full list of planning fees is available on the Epsom and Ewell Borough Council website. Remember to budget for potential additional costs, such as pre-application advice fees or fees for a Bat Survey if required."
