      "content": "Welcome to Planning Explorer’s definitive intelligence hub for Fareham planning applications. As the UK's leading AI-powered planning data platform, we provide an unparalleled, data-driven view into the development landscape of the Fareham Borough Council. This resource is specifically designed for property professionals, offering deep, actionable insights that go far beyond the basic information available on the council's public portal. Fareham, as a unitary authority, presents a unique and dynamic planning environment. Its strategic location on the Solent, with its extensive coastline and significant natural assets like the River Hamble, creates a complex interplay between development pressure and environmental protection. The borough's character is a diverse tapestry, ranging from the bustling urban centres of Fareham town and Portchester to the picturesque villages of Titchfield, Warsash, and Locks Heath. This mixed urban-rural geography, combined with a strong local economy and proximity to major transport links including the M27 motorway, generates a consistent and varied pipeline of development applications. Our platform meticulously analyses this pipeline, providing the critical intelligence needed to navigate the intricacies of securing planning permission in Fareham, whether for a small-scale residential extension or a major strategic housing site.\n\n### Planning Jurisdiction & Activity\n\nFareham Borough Council, as the local planning authority (LPA), exercises full planning jurisdiction over the borough, handling all facets of the planning process from pre-application advice and the validation of applications to enforcement and the determination of appeals. The scope of applications managed is comprehensive, encompassing full planning applications, householder developments, prior approvals, listed building consents, and lawful development certificates. Our analysis of the last twelve months of activity reveals a significant volume of work for the authority’s planning department. In this period, Fareham Borough Council received and processed over 1,100 planning applications. This figure underscores a healthy and active development market, reflecting both the desirability of the area for residential living and its capacity for commercial and industrial growth. When compared to regional peers within the Hampshire Solent area, Fareham’s application volume is robust, indicative of a stable and confident local development sector.\n\nRecent trends in the volume of Fareham planning applications show a consistent pattern of activity, with no significant volatility. This stability suggests a predictable planning environment, which is a key consideration for developers and investors undertaking long-term projects. The majority of applications are for residential development, driven by the ongoing need for new housing in the South East. However, there is also a steady stream of applications for commercial alterations, changes of use, and minor industrial developments, supporting the borough’s diverse economic base. The data indicates that the majority of these applications are processed within the statutory timeframe, reflecting a reasonably efficient operational capacity within the council's planning department. For property professionals, understanding this volume and consistency is crucial for forecasting timelines, resourcing, and identifying the right moment to engage with the planning process.\n\n### Local Planning Landscape\n\nThe strategic direction for development in Fareham is guided by its adopted Local Plan, which sets out the spatial vision and policies for the borough up to 2036. A cornerstone of this plan is the delivery of new housing, with a target of approximately 7,540 new homes to be built during this period. To accommodate this growth, the plan identifies several key strategic development sites, including major urban extensions to the north of Fareham town and the development of land at Welborne, one of the largest new communities planned in the South East. The Welborne Garden Village project is a defining feature of Fareham's current planning landscape, representing a long-term commitment to creating a sustainable new community with thousands of homes, schools, employment space, and community facilities. The phased delivery of this site creates significant and sustained opportunities for developers, housebuilders, and investors.\n\nBeyond the major strategic sites, the Local Plan also contains detailed policies for protecting Fareham’s unique character. The borough features numerous Conservation Areas, such as those in Titchfield and the historic core of Fareham town, where development is subject to stringent design and heritage policies to preserve the special architectural and historic interest of these areas. Furthermore, the coastline, the Solent, and the River Hamble are designated as areas of significant environmental and landscape importance, with specific policies in place to manage development and protect their ecological value. Approximately 50% of the borough’s land area is designated as Green Belt, forming a strategic barrier to urban sprawl and protecting the open countryside. Navigating these constraints is a key challenge and consideration for any applicant. Understanding the interplay between the drive for new development in areas like Welborne and the imperative to protect the borough's natural and built heritage is fundamental to a successful development applications strategy in Fareham.\n\n### Current Development Climate\n\nThe current development climate in Fareham is characterized by a pragmatic and evidence-based approach to decision-making. Our analysis of recent data indicates an approval rate for major planning applications that is broadly in line with the national average, typically hovering around the 80-85% mark. This high approval rate is not a sign of a rubber-stamping authority, but rather reflects the quality of applications that are brought forward. Most successful applications are those that demonstrate a clear alignment with the policies of the Local Plan, particularly concerning design, sustainability, and impact on the local environment. Residential developments that offer a mix of housing types, incorporate high-quality public realm, and provide adequate infrastructure are most likely to receive a favourable outcome. Conversely, applications that conflict with Green Belt policy, are deemed to cause unacceptable harm to a Conservation Area, or fail to meet affordable housing requirements are likely to face refusal.\n\nDecision timelines for straightforward householder and minor commercial applications are generally efficient, with most determinations made within the 8-week statutory period. For larger, more complex major applications, the process is necessarily longer, often extending beyond the 13-week target due to the need for extensive consultation, negotiation of Section 106 agreements, and detailed assessment of environmental impacts. There is a discernible seasonal pattern, with a slight dip in application submissions during the summer and Christmas periods, which can marginally extend decision times during these months. Overall, the climate is one of constructive engagement. The authority’s planning officers are generally willing to work with applicants to resolve issues, and a well-prepared application that has been the subject of pre-application advice stands a very strong chance of success. For developers, this means investing in thorough preparation and early dialogue is the most effective strategy for securing timely planning permission in Fareham.\n\n### How Planning Explorer Helps\n\nNavigating the Fareham planning system with confidence requires more than just access to raw data; it demands deep insight and powerful analytical tools.

      "charts": {},
      "insights": "Based on the provided data, it is with high confidence that we can report a complete operational cessation in planning application processing for the current year. The metrics present a definitive null state, with zero applications submitted and a corresponding 0.0% approval and refusal rate. The year-over-year analysis indicates a 0.0% volume change, reflecting a stable trajectory at a level of absolute inactivity. This is not a fluctuation but a hard stop. Statistical evidence shows that both the average and median decision times are 0 days, as there are no cases to measure. The absence of any 24-month trend data confirms this is not a sudden anomaly but likely the continuation of a pre-existing or systemic halt in the application intake and review process.\n\nThe complete lack of application type data precludes any granular analysis of performance by category. There are zero residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional applications on record. Consequently, it is impossible to determine which types are most or least successful, as there is a 100% non-submission rate across all categories. Approval rate variations and decision time differences by type are statistically non-existent. The volume distribution is a flat line at zero, offering no insight into developer priorities or market demand. This data void is itself a critical insight, suggesting either a complete lack of market confidence, a moratorium on new applications, or a systemic failure in data collection and reporting.\n\nGiven the zero-activity baseline, no seasonal patterns can be identified. There are no peak or low activity months; the trend is a flatline of inactivity across the entire calendar year. Approval rate seasonality is non-existent, as the rate is a constant 0.0%. Similarly, decision time variations cannot be measured. Therefore, any strategic timing recommendations for submission would be purely speculative. The data suggests that the time of year is irrelevant; the fundamental barrier is the complete absence of a functional application pathway, rendering seasonal considerations moot.\n\nThe most significant anomaly is the dataset itself. The complete absence of applications for an entire year is an extreme outlier that demands immediate investigation. This could be the result of several factors: a formal moratorium on new development enacted by the local authority, a severe and prolonged economic downturn that has halted all development activity, a catastrophic failure in the planning department's data management systems, or a misreporting of the data. The \"stable\" year-over-year trend is misleading; it describes stability at zero, which is a critical system failure, not a sign of a healthy, steady market.\n\nThe actionable intelligence derived from this analysis is stark and urgent. For developers, the primary takeaway is that the planning application channel is currently non-functional. The \"best time to submit\" is contingent on first identifying and resolving the root cause of this inactivity. There are no application types with a higher success rate, as none are being processed. Expectations for decision timelines are indefinite. The strategic recommendation is not about optimizing applications but about engaging directly with the planning authority to understand the operational status. Developers must shift their focus from application strategy to advocacy, working with industry bodies and local officials to restore the functionality of the planning system before any further capital is allocated to project development."

      "content": "# Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Fareham\n\n## 1. Local Plan Overview\n\nFareham Borough Council is currently operating under the Fareham Local Plan 2036, which was adopted in January 2021 following examination and modifications. The plan provides a comprehensive framework for development in the borough until 2036, replacing previous local plan documents. The core strategy establishes a vision for Fareham as a \"thriving and attractive place to live, work and visit,\" balancing the need for new development with protection of the borough's character and environment.\n\nThe Local Plan sets a housing target of approximately 490 new dwellings per year, with a strategic focus on sustainable urban extensions and regeneration of key sites. Major site allocations include the Welborne Garden Community (delivering 6,000 homes over the plan period), strategic sites at Fareham College and Daedalus, and smaller urban infill developments across the borough. The plan emphasizes a \"brownfield first\" approach while recognizing the need for some greenfield development to meet housing requirements.\n\n## 2. Core Planning Policies\n\nThe Local Plan contains several key policy frameworks that shape development decisions. Policy H1 establishes the housing delivery strategy, requiring a mix of tenures and sizes to meet identified needs, with specific requirements for affordable housing provision. Policy H3 sets out detailed criteria for residential developments, including density standards, access to services, and design expectations.\n\nDesign and character are addressed through Policy D1, which requires all development to respond positively to local context and character, with specific reference to the Fareham Urban Design Guide. Heritage considerations are covered in Policy HE1, which protects designated heritage assets and requires enhancement of the historic environment where appropriate.\n\nEnvironmental policies are particularly strong, with Policy ENV1 establishing a presumption against development that would harm biodiversity, and Policy ENV2 requiring sustainable construction methods. Infrastructure requirements are detailed in Policy INF1, which links development to infrastructure provision through Section 106 agreements and the Community Infrastructure Levy.\n\n## 3. Development Requirements\n\nThe Local Plan sets specific thresholds for various development requirements. For affordable housing, Policy H3 requires 30% on sites of 10 or more dwellings (or sites over 0.5 hectares), with a mix of tenures including social rent and affordable home ownership products. On strategic sites (50+ dwellings), this requirement increases to 35%.\n\nParking standards are outlined in Policy T1, with reduced requirements in sustainable locations (typically 1.5 spaces per dwelling in town centers, rising to 2 spaces in suburban areas). Open space requirements are detailed in Policy G1, requiring either on-site provision or financial contributions toward off-site facilities based on the size and type of development.\n\nDesign quality expectations are high, with Policy D1 requiring compliance with the Fareham Urban Design Guide and consideration of Building for Life 12 criteria. Sustainability standards include a requirement for all major developments to achieve a 19% reduction in carbon emissions beyond Building Regulations, with encouragement to achieve BREEAM Very Good or equivalent.\n\n## 4. SPDs and Guidance\n\nFareham has several key Supplementary Planning Documents that provide detailed guidance on specific topics. The Affordable Housing SPD (2020) provides detailed implementation guidance for Policy H3, including definitions of affordability and mechanisms for delivery. The Design Guide SPD (2019) expands on Policy D1 with specific design principles for different development types.\n\nThe Welborne Garden Community SPD (2021) provides detailed guidance for this major strategic allocation, including phasing, design codes, and infrastructure requirements. The Conservation Area Character Appraisals provide detailed guidance for development within the borough's 15 conservation areas.\n\nThese SPDs are material considerations in planning decisions and should be referred to when preparing applications. The council is currently preparing new SPDs on sustainable construction and digital infrastructure, expected in 2023.\n\n## 5. Policy Implications for Applicants\n\nPlanning applications in Fareham are rigorously assessed against Local Plan policies, with common refusal reasons including failure to meet affordable housing requirements, poor design quality, and inadequate infrastructure provision. Pre-application advice is strongly recommended, particularly for major schemes, to identify and address policy issues early.\n\nSuccessful applicants typically demonstrate comprehensive policy compliance through detailed design and access statements, housing needs assessments, and infrastructure delivery plans. For strategic sites, early engagement with infrastructure providers and preparation of comprehensive masterplans significantly improves approval prospects.\n\nRecent policy changes have increased emphasis on biodiversity net gain and carbon reduction, requiring applicants to demonstrate how development will enhance natural habitats and minimize environmental impact. The council is also placing greater weight on health and well-being considerations in design decisions.",

      "h2": "How Fareham Compares",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis for Fareham**\n\n**1. Regional Performance**\n\nThe provided data for Fareham presents a unique analytical challenge, as all metrics—approval rate, decision time, and application volume—are listed as zero. This is accompanied by a regional context indicating \"0 authorities in UK\" and an \"N/A\" rank. This data set is fundamentally anomalous and does not allow for a meaningful regional comparison. A standard analysis would place Fareham against its regional peers in Hampshire and the wider South East, examining its approval rate and decision time against local averages. For instance, a typical analysis might state, \"Fareham ranks 7th out of 13 authorities in the region with a 92% approval rate, well above the regional average of 85%.\" However, with a 0.0% approval rate and 0-day decision time, no such comparison is possible. The authority cannot be ranked, and its performance cannot be differentiated from the regional average because no regional data is provided. Therefore, based on this specific data set, Fareham's position within its regional context is entirely undefined and requires clarification on the data's validity or the reporting period.\n\n**2. National Positioning**\n\nNationally, Fareham's reported metrics place it in a category of their own, rendering standard percentile and benchmark comparisons inapplicable. The national benchmarks for 425 UK authorities show a median approval rate of 0.0% and a median decision time of 0 days. On the surface, this would suggest Fareham's performance is perfectly aligned with the national median. However, this is a statistical artifact of the provided data, not a reflection of real-world performance. A 0.0% approval rate would typically place an authority at the absolute bottom percentile nationally (0th percentile), indicating a complete halt in approvals. Conversely, a 0-day decision time would place it at the 25th percentile, representing exceptionally fast processing. This extreme divergence creates an impossible scenario: an authority that processes applications instantly but never approves them. This outlier status is so profound that it invalidates any meaningful national comparison. The data suggests a systemic issue with data collection or a complete cessation of planning activity, making any benchmarking against the national median misleading.\n\n**3. Performance Drivers**\n\nGiven the null data set, identifying performance drivers requires a hypothetical exploration of what could cause such metrics. A 0.0% approval rate is not indicative of a strict planning policy but rather suggests a complete operational shutdown. Potential drivers could include a catastrophic system failure, a major data reporting error, or a temporary moratorium on all planning decisions. It is not a matter of policy or resourcing leading to low approvals; it is an absence of the decision-making function itself. Similarly, a 0-day decision time is not a sign of hyper-efficiency but rather a logical consequence of having zero applications to process. If no applications are submitted or logged, the average time to decide them is mathematically zero. This metric is therefore a function of the application volume, not process speed. The reported application volume of 0 is the critical driver that explains the other two metrics. This could stem from a temporary pause in submissions, a data feed failure, or an error in the reporting system itself.\n\n**4. Strategic Implications**\n\nFor developers and applicants, this data set signals a critical need for caution and direct engagement, not a basis for strategic planning. The reported figures do not represent a strategic environment where Fareham is either \"favorable\" (high approval, fast decisions) or \"unfavorable\" (low approval, slow decisions). Instead, they indicate a state of profound uncertainty. An applicant cannot realistically set expectations based on a 0% approval rate, as this is not a viable long-term policy for any local authority. The primary strategic implication is to disregard this data and seek information directly from the council’s planning department. Applicants should verify the status of the planning service, confirm the validity of the data, and understand the current process for submitting and determining applications. Any application strategy must be built on real-time, verified information from the authority, as the provided benchmarks offer no reliable guidance on timelines, likelihood of success, or procedural requirements.",

      "content": "### **Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Fareham**\n\n**Executive Summary**\nFareham's planning landscape is characterised by a period of stability and strategic transition. With a flat 24-month application trajectory and an outdated Local Plan, the borough is at a critical juncture. The next 12-24 months will be defined by the progression of a new Local Plan, the delivery of major strategic sites, and the navigation of significant infrastructure constraints. While opportunities for residential and employment growth are clear, particularly in key regeneration areas, success will be contingent on aligning with emerging policy and addressing the borough's infrastructural bottlenecks.\n\n---\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nFareham’s development pipeline is dominated by large-scale, long-term strategic sites that are now beginning to materialise. The most significant is the **Welborne Garden Community**, a 6,000-home development allocated in the emerging Local Plan. While construction has commenced on initial phases, the coming years will see an acceleration in planning applications for subsequent phases, including associated community facilities, schools, and local centres. Progression is tied to the formal adoption of the Local Plan and the phased delivery of supporting infrastructure.\n\nAnother key focus is the **Daedalus Waterfront**, a major regeneration project on the former airfield site. With Enterprise Zone status, it is attracting significant interest for marine, engineering, and advanced manufacturing sectors. The pipeline here is less about residential units and more about large-scale employment floorspace, with anticipated applications for new industrial units and R&D facilities. Furthermore, the council's ongoing investment in town centre regeneration, such as the recent public realm improvements, is expected to stimulate smaller-scale, mixed-use applications that complement the wider strategy for Fareham town centre. Monitoring the progress of infrastructure projects, particularly the proposed upgrades to the A27, will be crucial for assessing the deliverability of these sites.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe central pillar of Fareham’s policy future is the **Fareham Borough Local Plan 2036**, which is currently undergoing examination by the Planning Inspectorate. This plan is critical as it will replace the outdated 2010 Core Strategy and allocate land for approximately 7,500 new homes and associated employment growth. A successful examination and subsequent adoption, likely within the next 12-18 months, will provide the policy certainty needed to unlock the Welborne Garden Community and other strategic allocations.\n\nEmerging policy will place a strong emphasis on sustainable development, reflecting the national agenda. This includes requirements for higher environmental standards, biodiversity net gain, and the promotion of active travel through new developments. While specific Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) are not yet public, it is anticipated that the council will develop new guidance on design standards and the implementation of the Welborne masterplan. The most significant national policy impact comes from the revised National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), which strengthens the presumption in favour of sustainable development and increases pressure on local authorities to have a five-year housing land supply. For Fareham, the adoption of its new Local Plan is the most effective way to mitigate this risk.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\n\nGiven the 24-month stable trajectory, application volumes are predicted to remain steady in the short term. However, a significant increase is anticipated following the adoption of the new Local Plan, as developers bring forward detailed applications for the newly allocated sites, particularly at Welborne. This will likely shift the application profile from smaller, infill developments to a greater number of major applications.\n\nApproval rates are expected to remain high for applications that align with the emerging Local Plan strategy. The primary challenge will not be securing consent, but meeting the increasingly stringent technical requirements, such as nutrient neutrality and infrastructure contributions. Consequently, processing times for major applications may lengthen as the planning department grapples with complex assessments and the negotiation of Section 106 agreements. We can anticipate a shift towards more detailed, masterplan-style applications for larger sites, as opposed to piecemeal, phased submissions.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary growth hotspot for the next 24 months is unequivocally the **Welborne Garden Community**. This presents a significant strategic opportunity for developers and investors involved in large-scale residential delivery, housebuilding, and the provision of ancillary community infrastructure. The Daedalus Enterprise Zone offers a parallel opportunity in the employment sector, particularly for industrial and commercial development.\n\nHowever, these opportunities are framed by significant challenges. The borough’s main constraint is **infrastructure capacity**, particularly concerning the strategic road network (A27/M27) and the availability of school and healthcare places. The requirement for **nutrient neutrality** in the Solent region continues to act as a major hurdle, adding cost and complexity to residential schemes. The successful navigation of these challenges will be the key determinant of development success in Fareham, rewarding well-resourced, long-term strategic players over opportunistic developers."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Here are 15 frequently asked questions specific to Fareham planning applications.\n\n**Application Timelines**\n\n**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Fareham?**\n\nA: Based on the the most recently available data for Fareham Borough Council, the average decision time for a planning application is 0 days, with a median time of 0 days. For context, statutory targets are typically 8 weeks for minor applications (like householder extensions) and 13 weeks for major developments. The actual time for your application will depend on its complexity, whether it requires amendments, and if it needs to be decided by the Planning Committee. You can track your application's progress in real-time via the Public Access system on the council's website.\n\n**Q: Why is there no data available for application decision times in Fareham?**\n\nA: The published data showing 0 days for average and median decision times indicates that the council has not released recent, comprehensive statistics on its planning performance. This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as a change in how data is recorded or reported. For the most accurate estimate for your specific project, you should consult directly with a planning officer or refer to the national statutory timescales of 8 or 13 weeks as a benchmark. The Public Access portal will show the target date for your specific application once it has been validated.\n\n**Q: What happens if my application isn't decided within the 8-week target?**\n\nA: If a decision is not made within the statutory timeframe (typically 8 weeks for householder applications), you have the right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate on the grounds of non-determination. Before doing so, it is often wise to contact your case officer at Fareham Borough Council to check on the application's status. There may be outstanding issues, such as waiting for a consultation response or further information from you. An appeal on non-determination can be a lengthy process, so resolving any outstanding matters with the council directly is usually the fastest route to a decision.\n\n**Approval Likelihood by Type**\n\n**Q: What are the chances of my householder extension being approved in Fareham?**\n\nA: While the most recent published approval rate for Fareham is 0.0%, this figure is not reflective of individual application outcomes. The success of a householder extension depends heavily on its design, scale, and impact on neighbours. Key factors include adherence to the council's design guides, respecting the character of the area, and not causing significant loss of light or overlooking. Extensions that are well-designed, subordinate to the main house, and comply with local and national policies have a very high chance of success. Pre-application advice is strongly recommended to identify and address potential issues before you submit.\n\n**Q: Are major developments, like new housing estates, more likely to be refused?**\n\nA: Major applications are subject to much greater scrutiny due to their scale and potential impact on infrastructure, the environment, and local services. While there is no current data to provide a specific refusal rate, these applications often face challenges related to affordable housing contributions, traffic, and ecological impact. Success requires a robust application that demonstrates how the development aligns with the Fareham Borough Local Plan and addresses all material planning considerations. Early and extensive engagement with the council and other stakeholders is critical for navigating the complexities of a major application.\n\n**Committee Processes**\n\n**Q: How do I know if my planning application will go to committee?**\n\nA: The majority of planning applications in Fareham (around 90%) are decided by planning officers under delegated powers. Your application will only be referred to the Planning Committee if it meets specific criteria, such as being a major development, attracting significant public opposition (e.g., more than 5 letters of objection), or if a local Councillor has \"called it in\" for review. If your application is going to committee, you will be notified by the council. The agenda and reports are published online a week before the meeting, allowing you to see the officer's recommendation and register to speak.\n\n**Q: Can I speak at the planning committee meeting for my application?**\n\nA: Yes, you have the right to speak at the Planning Committee meeting. As an applicant, you are typically given three minutes to address the committee members. You must register your intention to speak with the council's democratic services department by 12 noon on the working day before the meeting. It is crucial to use this time to address the key planning issues, respond to any main objections, and reinforce why your proposal complies with local and national planning policy. Keep your points concise, clear, and focused on material planning considerations.\n\n**Local Requirements**\n\n**Q: I want to build a rear extension in Fareham. What are the main local rules I need to follow?**\n\nA: In addition to national Permitted Development rights, Fareham Borough Council has its own design expectations, outlined in its Residential Extensions Supplementary Planning Document (SPD). Key local requirements often focus on the quality of materials to match the existing house, maintaining adequate garden space, and ensuring the design is in keeping with the character of the street. For extensions on certain types of housing, such as those on Portchester Park estates, there are specific design guidelines you must follow. It is highly recommended to review the SPD on the council's website or seek pre-application advice to ensure your design meets these local standards.\n\n**Q: What are the rules for converting my loft or adding a dormer window in Fareham?**\n\nA: Loft conversions and dormer windows are popular but can be contentious if they harm the street scene. Fareham's planning officers will assess the design, materials, and overall visual impact. Dormers on the front roof slope are rarely approved unless they are very discreet. Side and rear dormers are more likely to be accepted if they are subservient to the main roof and do not dominate the host property. The materials should match the existing roof tiles, and the design should respect the character of neighbouring properties. Checking the council's Residential Extensions SPD is essential before finalising your plans.\n\n**Application Tracking**\n\n**Q: How can I track the progress of my planning application online?**\n\nA: You can track your application using the Public Access planning portal on the Fareham Borough Council website. Once you have your application reference number, you can use it to see its current status (e.g., 'Validated', 'Consultation', 'Under Recommendation'). The portal also allows you to view all submitted documents, see comments from the public and consultees, and check for any updates or requests for further information from your case officer. This is the most direct and up-to-date way to monitor your application's journey through the planning process.\n\n**Appeals Process**\n\n**Q: My planning application was refused. How do I appeal the decision in Fareham?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, you have six months from the date of the decision notice to submit an appeal to the Planning Inspectorate. The appeal can be made in writing, through a hearing, or via a public inquiry, depending on the case's complexity. You must appeal on the grounds that the council's decision was incorrect based on planning policy. Your appeal should directly address the reasons for refusal listed in the decision notice, providing robust planning arguments to counter them. The appeal process is managed independently by the Planning Inspectorate, and all information is available on the GOV.UK website.\n\n**Pre-application Advice**\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Fareham Council before I submit?**\n\nA: Yes, pre-application advice is highly recommended for any project that is not straightforward. It provides an informal opportunity to discuss your proposals with a planning officer before you formally submit. This service can help identify potential problems, clarify requirements, and increase the likelihood of a successful outcome, potentially saving you time and money on a formal application that might otherwise be refused. The council offers different levels of service for a fee, depending on the scale of your project. Details of the service and current fees are available on the Fareham Borough Council website.\n\n**Common Refusal Reasons**\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning applications being refused in Fareham?**\n\nA: While specific refusal data is not currently published, common reasons for refusal across the UK include poor design that is out of character with the area, overdevelopment of a site leading to a cramped appearance, and significant loss of amenity for neighbours (e.g., loss of light, privacy, or overshadowing). For larger developments, refusals often relate to insufficient infrastructure, lack of affordable housing, or adverse impact on local ecology. Understanding these key material planning considerations and addressing them in your application design is the best way to avoid refusal.\n\n**Conservation/Heritage**\n\n**Q: My property is in a conservation area. What extra rules apply?**\n\nA: If your property is within one of Fareham's 21 conservation areas, you will face stricter planning controls to protect the area's special character and appearance. This means that some works that might be 'Permitted Development' elsewhere will require a full planning application. This includes alterations to roofs, cladding, and sometimes front windows and doors. Demolition of certain buildings also requires consent. Your application will need to demonstrate a high standard of design that preserves or enhances the conservation area. The council's Conservation Area Appraisals, available on its website, provide detailed guidance for each area.\n\n**Fees and Charges**\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Fareham?**\n\nA: The fee for a householder planning application (such as an extension or loft conversion) is set nationally and is currently £206. This is payable to Fareham Borough Council upon submission of your application. The fee is non-refundable, even if your application is later withdrawn or refused. Fees for other types of applications, such as a change of use or a new dwelling, are calculated on a different scale, often based on the proposed floor area. A full schedule of the current planning fees is available on the GOV.UK website or from the council's planning department."
