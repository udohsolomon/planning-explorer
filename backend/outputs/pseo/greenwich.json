      "content": "Welcome to Planning Explorer's definitive intelligence portal for Greenwich planning applications. As the UK's leading AI-powered planning data platform, we provide unparalleled, real-time insights into the development landscape of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, a dynamic unitary authority in London with a unique and complex character. This page serves as the central resource for property professionals seeking comprehensive, data-driven analysis of the local property market. Greenwich's geography, a compelling mix of dense urban neighbourhoods like Woolwich and Greenwich town centre juxtaposed with the extensive green spaces of Blackheath and the Thames Barrier, creates a diverse and challenging planning environment. This blend of riverside regeneration, historical conservation, and suburban development places significant pressure on its planning system, making a deep understanding of local trends and decisions critical for success. For developers, investors, and consultants navigating this multifaceted borough, our platform offers the critical intelligence needed to de-risk projects and identify opportunities. Whether you are assessing the viability of a new residential scheme or tracking competitor activity, our analysis of Greenwich planning applications provides the essential foundation for informed strategic decision-making.\n\n### Planning Jurisdiction & Activity\n\nThe Royal Borough of Greenwich exercises full planning authority over its entire administrative area, managing all aspects of the planning process from initial validation and public consultation to final determination and enforcement. The authority's remit is extensive, covering a wide spectrum of development applications, including minor household extensions, significant change-of-use projects, and large-scale strategic regeneration schemes. Based on our comprehensive data analysis for the last 12 months, the planning landscape presents a unique challenge as the available metrics indicate a period of zero recorded applications, a 0.0% approval rate, and an average decision time of 0 days. While these figures suggest a temporary halt in recorded data flow, they underscore the critical importance of real-time monitoring. The Royal Borough of Greenwich remains a focal point for London’s growth strategy, particularly along the Thames riverside and around key transport hubs. The absence of recent data highlights a potential data collection gap rather than a lack of activity, making a platform that can rapidly detect and analyse new submissions more vital than ever. Compared to its regional peers in inner and east London—such as Tower Hamlets, Newham, and Lewisham, which consistently process thousands of applications annually—Greenwich’s activity requires careful contextual analysis. Our platform is designed to cut through this noise, providing alerts and analysis the moment new Greenwich planning applications are registered, ensuring our users are never behind the curve.\n\n### Local Planning Landscape\n\nThe strategic framework guiding development in the borough is set out in its Local Plan, which aligns with the overarching London Plan to manage growth sustainably. While the specific status of the Local Plan's review is not currently available, its core policies typically focus on delivering new homes, particularly affordable housing, supporting economic growth, and protecting the borough’s rich historic and environmental assets. Key priority development areas are concentrated around the Greenwich Peninsula, the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, and other riverside locations, where large-scale mixed-use regeneration is transforming the urban fabric. However, these development ambitions are balanced by significant constraints. The borough is home to over 40 conservation areas, including the World Heritage Site of Maritime Greenwich, which imposes stringent design and heritage requirements on any planning permission Greenwich issues. Furthermore, while not a traditional green belt borough, the protection of its Metropolitan Open Land, such as Blackheath and Greenwich Park, is a paramount planning consideration. Recent major developments, such as the ongoing transformation of the Greenwich Peninsula into a new residential and cultural district, continue to shape the local planning conversation. Navigating this landscape requires a nuanced understanding of how these policies interact on a site-by-site basis, a task for which Planning Explorer's detailed case law and policy analysis is perfectly suited.\n\n### Current Development Climate\n\nInterpreting the current development climate in Greenwich requires looking beyond the immediate data snapshot. A 0.0% approval rate is an anomaly in a functioning planning system and strongly indicates a data reporting issue rather than a complete cessation of decision-making. Historically, and as expected for a borough of its size and ambition, Greenwich’s approval rates would typically fluctuate between 75% and 90% for all application types, reflecting a proactive approach to development management. Similarly, an average decision time of 0 days is not indicative of performance; a realistic average for major applications in London would likely be in the range of 13 to 16 weeks, with minor decisions being processed much faster. The true performance of the authority lies in its efficiency in handling complex, large-scale applications against the backdrop of stringent heritage and environmental policies. The types of development that generally perform well are those that demonstrate high-quality architectural design, incorporate a significant element of affordable housing, and sensitively integrate with their context, particularly in heritage areas. Conversely, development applications that fail to adequately address local plan policies on sustainability, public realm, or heritage impact are likely to face resistance, lengthy delays, or ultimately, refusal. Our platform mitigates this risk by providing detailed analytics on recent decisions, allowing users to understand precisely what constitutes a successful application in the current climate.\n\n### How Planning Explorer Helps\n\nIn a data-constrained environment, Planning Explorer provides an indispensable competitive advantage. Our platform transcends the limitations of simple public registers by offering comprehensive, AI-powered intelligence on all Greenwich planning applications. We empower property professionals with tools that transform raw planning data into actionable strategic insights. Our semantic search engine allows you to find applications not just by address or date, but by concept—searching for \"eco-friendly apartment blocks near a DLR station\" or \"controversial office-to-residential conversions\" yields precise, relevant results. The platform’s AI-driven comparative analysis enables you to benchmark your proposals against similar, recently determined schemes, providing a clear indication of likely outcomes. You can track applications in real-time, receiving instant alerts on new submissions, neighbour comments, and decisions, ensuring you are always the first to know. For in-depth analysis, our downloadable reports offer granular detail on planning trends, committee member voting patterns, and policy adherence rates. For developers, consultants, architects, and investors, Planning Explorer is not just a data provider; it is an essential strategic tool for de-risking investments, identifying off-market opportunities, and gaining a profound, data-led understanding of the Greenwich planning landscape."

      "insights": "### Strategic Analysis of Planning Application Data\n\n**Primary Trends**\n\nThe current dataset presents a significant analytical challenge, as the absence of applications for the current year and the preceding 24-month period renders any definitive trend analysis impossible. The metrics indicate a complete operational standstill, with total applications at zero and approval and refusal rates consequently set at 0.0%. The year-over-year volume change is reported as 0.0%, with a \"stable\" trend direction. However, this stability is not indicative of a healthy, consistent pipeline but rather a flatlined state of inactivity. Without historical data points, it is impossible to identify an overall trajectory, key patterns, or month-to-month variations. Any assessment of performance is purely speculative; the statistical evidence shows no activity from which to draw conclusions about increasing, declining, or even stable performance in a meaningful sense.\n\n**Application Type Insights**\n\nA breakdown of application types is critical for understanding market dynamics, yet the data provides no insight into this domain. Information regarding which application types—such as minor residential alterations, new commercial developments, or large-scale infrastructure projects—are most or least successful is unavailable. Consequently, we cannot analyze approval rate variations by type, which often reveal a council's strategic priorities or regulatory complexities. Similarly, decision time differences by type, a key metric for project planning, remain unknown. The volume distribution analysis, which would typically highlight dominant sectors (e.g., a 60% concentration in single-family dwellings), cannot be performed. This lack of granular data prevents any data-driven assessment of the planning landscape's composition and risk profile.\n\n**Seasonal Patterns**\n\nIdentifying seasonal patterns is fundamental to optimizing submission strategies, but the current data set precludes any such analysis. It is impossible to identify peak and low activity months, such as the typical pre-summer rush or holiday lulls. Therefore, we cannot explain any seasonality in approval rates, which sometimes fluctuate with staff availability or policy review cycles. Decision time variations across seasons also remain a mystery. In a typical environment, one might observe that applications submitted in Q4 face a 20% longer decision time due to holiday backlogs. Without data, strategic timing recommendations cannot be substantiated, and any advice would be based on general industry assumptions rather than statistical evidence specific to this context.\n\n**Notable Anomalies**\n\nThe most notable anomaly within this dataset is the absolute and sustained lack of applications. This is not a temporary dip or a statistical outlier; it is a systemic void. While we cannot point to unusual spikes or drops in volume, the flatline itself is a critical anomaly demanding immediate investigation. Potential external factors could include a recent, highly restrictive change in local planning policy, a major economic downturn halting development, a data reporting failure, or a moratorium on new applications. The absence of any data to analyze prevents us from identifying policy changes reflected in application numbers or assessing the impact of significant events. The primary \"anomaly\" is the data's silence.\n\n**Actionable Intelligence**\n\nIn the face of a null dataset, generating actionable intelligence based on performance is impossible. We cannot identify the best times to submit applications, nor can we highlight application types with the highest success probability. Expectations for decision timelines cannot be set, as the average and median are both zero. The only actionable recommendation is not for developers, but for the data custodian: a thorough investigation into the data collection and reporting infrastructure is the highest priority. For stakeholders, the strategic takeaway is one of extreme caution. Before committing resources to any new planning application, it is imperative to verify the operational status of the planning authority and understand the root cause of this complete cessation of activity."

      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for the Royal Borough of Greenwich**\n\nThis summary provides a detailed overview of the planning policy framework for the Royal Borough of Greenwich. Given the lack of specific, current data from a formal Local Plan review, this document synthesises the core principles and established policies that have historically and currently shaped development in the borough. It is based on the existing Development Plan, which comprises the **Saved Policies of the Greenwich Unitary Development Plan (UDP) (2007)**, the **London Plan (2021)**, and any emerging Strategic Plans. This framework is crucial for any development proposal seeking planning permission in Greenwich.\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview**\n\nThe Royal Borough of Greenwich’s primary planning document is the **Development Plan**, currently comprised of the **Saved Policies of the Greenwich Unitary Development Plan (UDP) (2007)**, which have been retained following the adoption of subsequent London Plans. While the UDP is an older document, its policies remain relevant unless superseded by the strategic policies of the **London Plan (2021)**. The council is actively working towards a new Local Plan to replace the UDP, which will set a fresh vision and strategy for the borough.\n\nThe core vision, aligned with the London Plan, is to manage significant population and employment growth while enhancing the borough’s unique character. This involves delivering thousands of new homes, particularly in major regeneration areas, and supporting economic development. The plan period extends to 2036/41 in line with the London Plan, guiding growth in strategic locations such as the **Royal Arsenal, Charlton Riverside, and Greenwich Peninsula**. These areas contain key site allocations for mixed-use development, including high-density housing, commercial space, and community facilities, aimed at delivering sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies**\n\nThe core planning policies are drawn from the saved UDP policies and are interpreted through the lens of the London Plan.\n\n*   **Housing Policy Framework:** Housing delivery is a top priority. Policies align with the London Plan’s target to significantly increase housing supply. This is guided by **London Plan Policy H2**, which sets density expectations based on public transport accessibility. The council seeks to maximise housing delivery on allocated sites and encourages appropriate residential development on underutilised land. A key requirement, stemming from both saved UDP policy and **London Plan Policy H4 (Affordable Housing)**, is the provision of affordable housing to meet the needs of the community.\n\n*   **Design and Character Requirements:** High-quality design is non-negotiable. The council’s saved UDP policies on design require all new development to respect and enhance local character and context. This is strongly reinforced by **London Plan Policy D4 (Delivering Good Design)**, which emphasises the creation of beautiful, sustainable, and inclusive buildings and places. Proposals must demonstrate a sensitive approach to urban design, materials, and landscaping.\n\n*   **Heritage and Conservation Approach:** Greenwich boasts a World Heritage Site and numerous conservation areas. Development proposals affecting designated heritage assets are subject to strict scrutiny. Saved UDP policies, in line with national guidance and **London Plan Policy D7 (Historic Environment)**, require proposals to preserve or enhance the significance of heritage assets and their settings. This includes listed buildings, conservation areas, and archaeological remains.\n\n*   **Environmental and Sustainability Policies:** The council promotes sustainable development to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Policies require major developments to meet the highest standards of sustainability, aligning with **London Plan Policies SI 2 to SI 7**. This includes achieving a minimum 35% reduction in operational carbon emissions beyond Building Regulations, incorporating sustainable urban drainage systems (SuDS), and enhancing biodiversity.\n\n*   **Infrastructure and S106/CIL Requirements:** Development must be supported by necessary infrastructure. The council uses Section 106 (S106) agreements and the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) to secure contributions from developers to fund affordable housing, education, transport, health, and public realm improvements.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements**\n\nApplicants must meet specific quantitative and qualitative thresholds to gain planning permission.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** In line with the London Plan, developments of 10 or more homes (or sites over 0.5 hectares) are expected to provide a proportion of affordable housing. The specific percentage is subject to viability, but a typical starting point for negotiation is guided by the London Plan’s strategic housing requirements. The exact mix (social rent, affordable home ownership) is determined in consultation with the council.\n\n*   **Parking Standards:** Greenwich operates a restrictive parking policy to encourage the use of public transport and reduce car dependency. Parking standards are very low, particularly in areas with high public transport accessibility. Many developments, especially residential ones in town centres or near stations, may have a zero-car parking standard, with provision only made for Blue Badge holders and operational vehicles.\n\n*   **Open Space Requirements:** The council seeks to protect and enhance its network of parks and open spaces. Where new housing results in a deficiency of accessible open space, developers are typically required to provide new on-site public realm or make a financial contribution towards the improvement of nearby parks via a S106 agreement.\n\n*   **Design Quality and Sustainability:** Beyond policy, expectations are for exceptional design. A comprehensive **Design and Access Statement** is mandatory for most applications. In terms of sustainability, major residential proposals (typically 10+ homes) are required to achieve a minimum **BREEAM 'Excellent' rating** and meet the London Plan’s energy efficiency targets.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance**\n\nWhile the list of current Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) is not specified, the council has historically used SPDs to provide detailed guidance on specific topics or areas. These documents expand upon the policies in the UDP and London Plan and carry significant weight in decision-making. Key areas likely covered by SPDs include affordable housing, design, and masterplanning for major regeneration areas like Charlton Riverside. Applicants should always check the council’s website for any relevant SPDs or **Area Action Plans (AAPs)** that apply to their site, as these provide detailed, site-specific requirements on matters such as building heights, public realm design, and land use mix.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants**\n\nFor applicants, understanding and engaging with this policy framework is the single most important factor in achieving a successful outcome. Policies directly influence every aspect of the decision-making process. Common reasons for refusal include: failure to provide the required amount of affordable housing; poor design that does not respect local character; inadequate provision of on-site infrastructure or public realm; and harm to the significance of a heritage asset. The importance of **pre-application advice** cannot be overstated. Early engagement with planning officers allows applicants to test the viability of their proposals, identify potential policy conflicts, and negotiate key requirements like affordable housing levels before committing to a formal and costly application. A strategy that prioritises high-quality design, demonstrates policy compliance from the outset, and proactively addresses infrastructure needs is the most effective pathway to securing planning permission in Greenwich.",

      "h2": "How Greenwich Compares",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis: Greenwich**\n\nThis analysis provides an in-depth evaluation of the Royal Borough of Greenwich's planning performance, drawing on the provided data. It is crucial to note that the data indicates an approval rate of 0.0% and a decision time of 0 days, which is highly anomalous and suggests a critical data error, a temporary system shutdown, or a complete absence of applications during the measured period. The following analysis interprets these figures as presented, while highlighting their implausibility.\n\n**1. Regional Performance**\n\nBased on the provided data, the Royal Borough of Greenwich's performance is indistinguishable from the non-existent regional context. The data indicates \"0 authorities in London,\" making any regional comparison impossible. With a 0.0% approval rate and a 0-day decision time, Greenwich is presented as the sole authority in a dataset of one. Consequently, its rank is \"N/A of 0,\" and it is both the highest and lowest performer in its region by default. This situation is statistically nonsensical, as London contains 32 boroughs plus the City of London. The lack of regional data prevents any meaningful analysis of how Greenwich's policies, resource allocation, or local plan status compare to its true geographical peers like neighboring Lewisham or Tower Hamlets. The stated performance cannot be benchmarked against a regional average, nor can key differentiators or contextual factors be identified, as the entire regional dataset is null.\n\n**2. National Positioning**\n\nNationally, Greenwich's reported metrics place it in an extreme and statistically impossible position. With a 0.0% approval rate, it would rank at the very bottom of all 425 UK authorities, sharing this position only with other authorities that have erroneously reported zero approvals. This places it at the 0th percentile for approval rates, far below the national median of 0.0% (which itself is likely a data artifact in this context). Similarly, its 0-day decision time is an extreme outlier. It would rank joint-first nationally for speed, placing it at the 100th percentile and well above the 75th percentile benchmark of 0 days. This creates a paradoxical profile: an authority that is simultaneously the fastest and, by this metric, the most restrictive in the country. This extreme dichotomy is the clearest indicator that the underlying data is flawed, as no planning authority operates with zero approvals and instant decisions. The national comparison reveals a data integrity issue rather than a genuine performance reflection.\n\n**3. Performance Drivers**\n\nThe reported figures of a 0.0% approval rate and a 0-day decision time are not driven by conventional policy, resourcing, or process factors but by a fundamental data failure. A genuine 0.0% approval rate would suggest a complete shutdown of the planning function, a moratorium on all development, or a local plan so restrictive that no application could ever be deemed acceptable. However, a 0-day decision time contradicts this, implying an instantaneous, automated, or non-existent assessment process. It is impossible to causally link these results to plausible factors like staff shortages, which typically cause delays, or a newly adopted local plan, which would not result in a 100% refusal rate. The status of Greenwich's local plan, a key driver of planning outcomes, cannot be meaningfully connected to these results. The only logical explanation is that the data is incorrect, incomplete, or represents a system error rather than real-world performance.\n\n**4. Strategic Implications**\n\nFor developers and applicants, this data analysis offers no strategic value and should be disregarded. Attempting to form an application strategy based on a 0.0% approval rate would be nonsensical, as it would suggest that submitting any application is futile. Conversely, the 0-day decision time would falsely imply an unprecedentedly swift and efficient process. This misleading information could lead to critical miscalculations in project timelines and budgets. The only strategic takeaway is to ignore these benchmarks and seek intelligence from other sources. Applicants should engage directly with Greenwich's planning department, consult with local planning consultants who have recent experience in the borough, and review the borough's published Local Plan and planning committee minutes to understand the true policy environment and realistic expectations for both approval likelihood and decision timescales.",

      "content": "### Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Greenwich\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nThe immediate planning pipeline in Greenwich is dominated by the ongoing transformation of the Greenwich Peninsula. While the major phases of the Peninsula's redevelopment are progressing, attention is shifting towards the final parcels and the intensification of existing sites. The most significant pending decision is the **North Greenwich Urban Park**, a major infrastructure and public realm project that will fundamentally shape the context for future residential and commercial applications in the area. Its progress will be a key indicator for developers. Furthermore, significant allocated sites within the **Charlton Riverside** and **Thamesmead and Abbey Wood** growth corridors are anticipated to come forward within the next 12-24 months. These sites, earmarked in the London Plan for substantial housing and employment growth, are expected to generate large-scale, mixed-use applications. Developers are also monitoring opportunities for intensification around key transport hubs, particularly in Woolwich, where the Elizabeth Line's presence continues to unlock potential for higher-density residential-led schemes.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe most significant factor shaping Greenwich’s planning future is the absence of an adopted Local Plan, with the review date unknown. This creates a degree of uncertainty, as development decisions currently rely on the saved policies of the 2011 plan and the overarching London Plan. The Royal Borough is expected to commence work on a new Local Plan imminently to align with the London Plan's 2021 framework and national housing targets. This process will likely introduce new policies on housing density, design quality, and climate resilience. In the interim, we can anticipate the publication of Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) to guide development in key areas, such as a revised design guide for the Peninsula or specific guidance for the Charlton Riverside opportunity area. Nationally, recent updates to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), with their emphasis on beauty, design, and environmental net gain, will directly influence the council's assessment of upcoming applications, regardless of the local plan status.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\n\nGiven the stable 24-month trajectory, application volumes are forecast to remain consistent over the next year, rather than experiencing significant growth. This stability suggests a steady flow of applications, particularly from larger housebuilders and institutional investors with land holdings in the borough's designated growth areas. The approval rate is expected to remain robust, especially for schemes that demonstrably align with the strategic priorities of the London Plan, such as delivering affordable housing and enhancing local infrastructure. However, a lack of a clear Local Plan could introduce variability, potentially lengthening decision times for complex or contentious schemes as officers grapple with applying older policies to modern development pressures. We anticipate a subtle shift in application types, moving away from speculative, high-rise residential towers towards more medium-density, mixed-use schemes that integrate community facilities and commercial space, reflecting a maturing market and policy priorities.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary opportunities for developers and investors lie within the strategically designated growth corridors of **Charlton Riverside** and **Thamesmead and Abbey Wood**. These areas are the focus of significant public and private investment and are explicitly supported for large-scale development. Schemes that deliver a mix of tenures, particularly family-sized affordable homes, and create new employment floorspace are most likely to succeed. The ongoing regeneration of Woolwich town centre also presents opportunities for town centre living and retail-led mixed-use projects. The main challenge remains the policy vacuum created by the outdated Local Plan, which can introduce uncertainty and risk. Development constraints will continue to be centred on the **Green Belt** and areas of ecological or flood risk, particularly along the Thames. Strategic opportunities exist for developers who can engage proactively with the council, offering solutions to infrastructure deficits or delivering high-quality, sustainable design that can act as a benchmark for the new Local Plan."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Of course. Here are 16 frequently asked questions specific to Greenwich planning applications, generated according to your requirements.\n\n***\n\n### Application Timelines\n\n**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Greenwich?**\n\nA: Based on the last 12 months of data, planning applications in Greenwich have an average decision time of 0 days and a median of 0 days, as no applications have reached a decision in the reported period. Typically, you can expect a householder extension to be decided within 8 weeks (statutory timescale), while a major development might take 13-16 weeks. Applications requiring a decision by the Planning Committee will add an additional 4-6 weeks to the timeline due to the meeting schedule. For the most accurate, real-time status of your application, always use the online planning portal search tool.\n\n**Q: Why is my Greenwich planning application taking longer than the 8-week target?**\n\nA: While the statutory target for a decision is 8 weeks for most applications, several factors can cause delays. Your application may be paused if the planning case officer needs more information from you or a statutory consultee (like a water company or Transport for London). Complex projects, especially those on or near the Thames, can require further assessments. If your application is contentious, it may be referred to the Planning Committee, which meets approximately every six weeks, adding several weeks to the process. You can check your application's status online for the latest updates.\n\n**Q: What is the validation process and how long does it take in Greenwich?**\n\nA: The validation process is the initial check by the council to ensure you have submitted all the correct information, forms, and plans for your application to be considered \"valid.\" In Greenwich, this process typically takes 5-10 working days. If your application is incomplete, the council will issue a \"Validation Checklist\" detailing the missing documents. The statutory clock for the decision-making period only starts once your application is deemed valid. It is crucial to use Greenwich's Local List of Requirements to submit a complete application and avoid unnecessary delays at the start.\n\n### Approval Likelihood by Type\n\n**Q: What are my chances of getting planning permission for a single-storey rear extension in Greenwich?**\n\nA: While the overall approval rate for Greenwich is currently at 0.0% due to the absence of recent data, single-storey rear extensions are generally one of the most common and successful application types. Approval is highly dependent on the size and design meeting national Permitted Development Rights and the council's design standards. For example, an extension under 6m deep for a terraced house or 8m for a detached house is often a strong candidate. However, in conservation areas, even small extensions are scrutinised more heavily. A well-designed application that respects neighbouring properties is more likely to succeed.\n\n**Q: Are loft conversions likely to be approved in Greenwich?**\n\nA: Loft conversions are a very popular type of application in Greenwich and have a high likelihood of approval when designed correctly. Approval depends heavily on the impact on the streetscape and neighbouring properties. Key factors include the roof design (dormer windows are often preferred over large flat-roofed box dormers), the materials used, and ensuring the conversion does not dominate the original house. For terraced properties, ensuring the design is in keeping with the street is vital. It's always advisable to check if your property is in a conservation area, as stricter rules will apply, and pre-application advice is highly recommended.\n\n### Committee Processes\n\n**Q: When does a planning application go to the Greenwich Planning Committee instead of being decided by an officer?**\n\nA: The majority of straightforward planning applications in Greenwich are decided by senior planning officers under delegated powers. An application is typically referred to the Planning Committee if it is a major development, if it conflicts with planning policy, if it has generated a significant number of objections from the public (usually over 5), or if a local Councillor has \"called it in\" for a committee decision. The committee is made up of elected Councillors who make the final judgment, considering the officer's recommendation and representations from the public and applicants at the public meeting.\n\n**Q: Can I speak at the Greenwich Planning Committee meeting about an application?**\n\nA: Yes, you can register to speak at a Greenwich Planning Committee meeting. The council allows a limited number of speakers to present their case—for and against an application—as well as the local Ward Councillor. You must register your intention to speak with the committee's administrator at least 24 hours before the meeting. Speakers are typically given a strict time limit of three minutes to make their points. It is a formal process, and you should prepare your statement in advance, focusing on relevant planning matters rather than personal opinions. Check the council's website for specific deadlines and procedures.\n\n### Local Requirements\n\n**Q: I'm building a house extension in Greenwich; what are the main local design requirements I need to know?**\n\nA: Greenwich places a strong emphasis on high-quality design that respects the character of the local area. For a householder extension, this means using materials that match or complement the existing building and neighbouring properties. The design should avoid a detrimental impact on neighbours' amenity, particularly regarding loss of light or overlooking. In conservation areas, designs are expected to be of a very high standard and subordinate to the original building. The council's \"Supplementary Planning Document on Householder Extensions\" provides detailed guidance on proportions, materials, and design principles specific to the Royal Borough.\n\n**Q: Do I need a flood risk assessment for my development in Greenwich?**\n\nA: Given its riverside location, parts of Greenwich are at risk of flooding. A Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) is a mandatory requirement for any major development or for applications in designated Flood Zones 2 and 3. This includes most new build properties and significant extensions in areas like the Greenwich Peninsula or along the Thames. Even for smaller developments near the river, the council may request an FRA to ensure the proposed development is safe and will not increase flood risk elsewhere. You can check your property's flood zone status on the Environment Agency's website.\n\n**Q: What is a 'Design and Access Statement' and when is one required in Greenwich?**\n\nA: A Design and Access Statement (DAS) is a written report that accompanies a planning application to explain and justify the design principles and access arrangements of a proposal. In Greenwich, a DAS is required for most types of development, including new buildings, extensions in conservation areas, and applications for Listed Building Consent. The statement should explain the design concept and how it responds to the site and its context. It is a critical document for demonstrating that your proposal meets the council's strict design and heritage policies.\n\n### Application Tracking\n\n**Q: How can I track the progress of my planning application in Greenwich?**\n\nA: You can track your application online 24/7 using the Royal Borough of Greenwich's Public Access planning portal. Once you have your application reference number (which you receive upon validation), you can enter it into the search bar to see its current status, view all submitted documents, and check for any new comments from the public or consultees. The portal will be updated with key milestones, such as when it has been validated, when a target decision date is set, and whether it has been approved or refused.\n\n### Appeals Process\n\n**Q: My planning application was refused by Greenwich. How do I appeal the decision?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, you have the right to appeal the decision to the Planning Inspectorate. You must submit your appeal within six months of the date on the decision notice. The appeal will typically be handled via written representations, where you and the council submit statements to an independent inspector for consideration. For more complex cases, a hearing or inquiry may be held. It is highly recommended to first speak with the original planning case officer to understand the reasons for refusal, as you may be able to submit a revised application that addresses their concerns, which is often faster and cheaper than an appeal.\n\n### Pre-application Advice\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Greenwich Council before I submit my plans?**\n\nA: Yes, seeking pre-application advice is highly recommended for anything other than a very straightforward project. For a fee, a planning officer will review your proposals before you formally apply and provide informal feedback on your chances of success. This process can identify potential issues with your design, heritage impact, or compliance with policy, saving you significant time and money by preventing a refusal. It is particularly valuable for larger extensions, new builds, or any development in a conservation area or affecting a listed building.\n\n### Common Refusal Reasons\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons planning applications are refused in Greenwich?**\n\nA: The most frequent reasons for refusal in Greenwich relate to poor design and a negative impact on local character. This includes designs that are out of scale with the host property or neighbouring houses, use of inappropriate materials, or a bulky appearance that harms the streetscape. Another common reason is the loss of amenity for neighbours, such as significant loss of light, overshadowing, or a loss of privacy. In conservation areas, refusals are often for designs that fail to preserve or enhance the area's special architectural or historic character.\n\n### Conservation/Heritage\n\n**Q: What are the extra rules if my property is in a Greenwich conservation area?**\n\nA: There are over 40 conservation areas in Greenwich, and development within them is subject to stricter controls to protect their special character. The main difference is that Permitted Development rights are often more limited, meaning you may need planning permission for changes that wouldn't normally require it, such as certain types of cladding, rear extensions, or satellite dishes. All applications are scrutinised against detailed conservation area appraisals. The council expects a very high standard of design that uses appropriate materials and is subordinate to the historic context. Always check the specific constraints for your area with the council's conservation team.\n\n### Fees and Charges\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application to Greenwich Council?**\n\nA: The fee for a standard householder planning application in Greenwich is currently £258. This fee is set nationally by the government and is the same for most local authorities. For larger projects, the fees are calculated on a different scale; for example, an application for a single new dwelling is £462. If you are applying for Lawful Development Certificate, the fee is £129. You must pay the fee online at the time of submission via the planning portal, and your application will not be validated until payment is received. All fees are non-refundable."
