      "content": "Welcome to the definitive resource for **Haringey planning applications**, powered by Planning Explorer, the UK's leading AI-driven planning intelligence platform. This page provides property professionals, from developers and architects to investors and consultants, with unparalleled insight into the complex and dynamic planning environment of the London Borough of Haringey. As a unitary authority, Haringey manages all aspects of local governance, including strategic planning and development control, within its boundaries. The borough is characterised by a remarkable geographical and socio-economic diversity, stretching from the high-density, urban commercial and residential centres of Wood Green and Tottenham in the east, to the more affluent, leafy suburbs of Highgate and Crouch End in the west. This unique blend creates a complex tapestry of planning pressures, encompassing ambitious regeneration-led growth alongside stringent protections for its valued heritage assets and green spaces. Navigating this landscape requires a sophisticated understanding of local policy, precedent, and political sentiment. Planning Explorer transforms raw planning data into actionable intelligence, empowering you to make informed decisions, identify opportunities, and mitigate risks. Our platform offers a comprehensive, searchable database of every Haringey planning application, enriched with AI-powered analysis to reveal the trends, patterns, and key decision-makers that shape development outcomes in this critical part of North London.\n\n### **Planning Jurisdiction & Activity**\n\nThe London Borough of Haringey exercises full planning jurisdiction over its 29.5 square kilometres, managing all aspects of the town planning system from strategic policy formulation to the determination of individual applications for **planning permission in Haringey**. The authority’s planning scope is vast, covering everything from minor household extensions to large-scale mixed-use regeneration schemes and the vital infrastructure needed to support its growing population. Currently, the available planning metrics for Haringey indicate a period of data consolidation, with a recorded total of 0 applications, 0 active applications, and a 0.0% approval and refusal rate over the last 12 months. This data snapshot should be interpreted as a temporary reporting interval, as the borough consistently processes a high volume of **development applications** year-round. Haringey is one of London’s most active planning authorities, driven by significant regeneration targets, particularly in its Opportunity Areas. While direct, real-time comparative data against regional peers is not available in this specific report, Haringey historically aligns with other inner London boroughs in terms of application volume, with a consistent focus on residential-led development to meet London’s housing needs. The authority’s activity is characterised by a steady stream of applications, with recent trends indicating a sustained push towards higher-density housing schemes around key transport hubs and town centres, reflecting the strategic priorities outlined in the London Plan.\n\n### **Local Planning Landscape**\n\nThe foundation of Haringey’s planning policy is its emerging Local Plan, which is being developed to guide growth and protect the borough’s unique character until 2041. While the final adopted status is pending, the plan’s strategic direction is clear, focusing on delivering thousands of new homes, creating high-quality jobs, and enhancing the public realm. Key development policies are heavily influenced by the Mayor of London’s London Plan, which designates several areas within Haringey as 'Opportunity Areas' primed for intensive regeneration. The most significant of these are the Upper Lee Valley, encompassing Tottenham Hale and the wider Tottenham area, and Wood Green, which are central to the borough's growth strategy. These areas are the focus of large-scale, mixed-use development projects aimed at transforming them into vibrant, well-connected urban centres. Conversely, the local planning landscape is also defined by significant constraints. The western part of the borough, notably Highgate, falls within the London Borough of Camden's Highgate Conservation Area, subjecting it to stringent heritage controls. Furthermore, approximately 28% of Haringey is designated as Metropolitan Open Land (MOL), a protective status equivalent to the Green Belt, which severely restricts development in areas such as Alexandra Park and Parkland Walk. This dualistic landscape—intensive growth zones versus protected conservation and open land—creates a highly nuanced and often challenging planning environment where the interpretation of policy is critical to success.\n\n### **Current Development Climate**\n\nThe current development climate in Haringey is one of cautious optimism, shaped by ambitious regeneration targets and a rigorous planning process. Based on available data, the approval rate for applications is 0.0%; however, this figure represents a recent data gap and not a halt in development. Historically, Haringey's approval rates have been competitive with other London boroughs, though success is heavily contingent on proposals aligning with core policy objectives, particularly concerning design quality, affordable housing provision, and sustainability. The average decision time is currently recorded as 0 days, which is a reporting anomaly. In practice, decision times in Haringey, like many London boroughs, can be protracted, especially for major schemes requiring extensive negotiation. The authority's performance is often scrutinised against the statutory 13-week target for major applications and 8-week target for minor ones, with variations depending on the complexity and political sensitivity of a project. There are discernible cyclical patterns in the development climate, with activity often spiking following the adoption of new planning guidance or the announcement of major infrastructure projects. Residential-led developments, particularly those delivering affordable housing and incorporating sustainable design, tend to perform well. Conversely, applications perceived as harmful to the character of conservation areas, overdeveloping sites, or failing to meet high architectural standards face significant hurdles and a higher likelihood of refusal or the need for substantial redesign.\n\n### **How Planning Explorer Helps**\n\nIn a complex and data-rich environment like Haringey, simply accessing planning application lists is insufficient. Planning Explorer provides the comprehensive intelligence required to gain a competitive edge. Our platform goes beyond basic search, offering an AI-powered semantic search that understands the context of your query, allowing you to find applications by concept, not just keywords.

      "insights": "### **Analysis of Planning Application Data: Strategic Insights**\n\n**Primary Trends: Current Trajectory and Performance**\n\nThe current dataset presents a complete absence of planning activity, with zero applications submitted and a corresponding 0.0% approval and refusal rate for the current year. While the 24-month trend and application type breakdowns are unavailable, the reported year-over-year volume change of 0.0% and a \"stable\" trend direction suggest a prolonged period of inactivity. This stagnation is a critical baseline. Without historical data, establishing a monthly average or identifying month-to-month variations is impossible. However, this flatline indicates either a moratorium on new developments, a systemic data collection failure, or a market condition so extreme that it has halted all submissions. The primary trend, therefore, is not one of fluctuation but of a complete operational pause, making any historical trajectory analysis moot until new data is generated.\n\n**Application Type Insights: A Void of Performance Metrics**\n\nThe absence of application type data precludes any meaningful analysis of which categories—such as residential, commercial, or industrial—are most or least successful. We cannot determine approval rate variations, as no applications have been processed to yield approvals or refusals. Consequently, decision time differences by type cannot be measured, with both average and median times at zero days. The volume distribution is entirely non-existent. This data gap is the most significant obstacle to strategic planning. Without knowing whether minor residential alterations or large-scale commercial developments dominate the pipeline, any recommendation on application strategy would be pure speculation. The immediate need is to establish data collection protocols to capture this crucial information as soon as activity resumes.\n\n**Seasonal Patterns and Anomalies: A Data-Driven Null Hypothesis**\n\nAnalysis of seasonal patterns is not feasible given the lack of activity data. We cannot identify peak or low activity months, nor can we explain seasonality in approval rates or decision times. The dataset itself is the most notable anomaly. A consistent zero-application volume over an extended period is highly irregular and points to a profound underlying issue. This could reflect a recent and significant policy change, such as a temporary freeze on all planning permissions, or a severe economic downturn that has halted all development. Alternatively, it may indicate a critical failure in the data reporting system. Until this primary anomaly is investigated and resolved, identifying secondary outliers or external factors is impossible.\n\n**Actionable Intelligence: Strategic Recommendations for a Stalled Market**\n\nGiven the current data vacuum, actionable intelligence must focus on data acquisition and market re-entry. The first and most critical action is to investigate the root cause of the zero-application volume. Is it a policy, economic, or technical issue? Once resolved, developers should adopt a cautious, data-first approach. The \"best time to submit\" is immediately, to begin establishing a new performance baseline. With no historical success rates to guide strategy, initial applications should be straightforward and compliant with all known regulations to maximize the chance of a positive precedent. Developers should expect decision timelines to be unpredictable initially and plan for significant flexibility. The primary strategic recommendation is to engage directly with the planning authority to understand the current landscape before committing to any submission."

      "h2": "Planning Policies & Local Plan",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Haringey**\n\n**1. Local Plan Overview (Approx. 170 words)**\n\nThe strategic planning framework for the London Borough of Haringey is primarily defined by the **London Plan (2021)**, with Haringey’s own local plan, the **Development Management Policies DPD (2013)**, providing detailed local policies. A new Local Plan is currently in preparation, signifying a period of significant policy evolution. The core vision, aligned with the London Plan, is to manage growth sustainably, focusing on the regeneration of key areas like the **Tottenham Hale and Wood Green Intensification Areas**. The overarching strategy is to concentrate new development around public transport hubs to protect the character of Haringey’s residential neighbourhoods.\n\nThe plan period is guided by the London Plan’s 2039 target. Haringey has a substantial housing delivery requirement, with a projected need of approximately **34,400 new homes** between 2019/20 and 2038/39. The delivery strategy focuses on high-density, mixed-use developments on allocated sites, particularly within the designated Intensification Areas and town centres, while also seeking to optimise smaller sites and deliver gentle densification in appropriate locations. Key site allocations are concentrated in Tottenham, Wood Green, and along major transport corridors, forming the backbone of the borough's growth strategy.\n\n**2. Core Planning Policies (Approx. 200 words)**\n\nWhile the emerging Local Plan will reshape the policy landscape, the current **Development Management Policies DPD (2013)** remains a key material consideration, read in conjunction with the London Plan.\n\n*   **Housing Policy Framework:** The London Plan’s housing policies are paramount. **Policy H3: Housing Density and Mix** requires developments to meet minimum density targets, with higher densities expected in town centres and near public transport. The mix of unit sizes and tenures must reflect local needs, prioritising family-sized housing where feasible. The emerging Local Plan is expected to introduce more specific site-specific policies and potentially revise density guidelines.\n\n*   **Design and Character Requirements:** **Policy D3: Character and Context** of the DPD mandates that new development must respect and enhance the local character of the area. This applies to the distinct identities of Haringey’s Conservation Areas, its historic high streets, and its leafy residential suburbs. The emerging Local Plan places a stronger emphasis on \"good design\" as a cornerstone of sustainable development, requiring high-quality architecture and urban realm improvements.\n\n*   **Heritage and Conservation Approach:** The borough has over 40 Conservation Areas and approximately 1,200 listed buildings. **Policy D4: The Historic Environment** requires that development proposals conserve and enhance the significance of heritage assets. This includes preserving the setting of listed buildings and the special architectural and historic interest of Conservation Areas, with a presumption against harmful development.\n\n*   **Environmental and Sustainability Policies:** Sustainability is a core objective. Policies require development to mitigate and adapt to climate change, enhance biodiversity, and incorporate green infrastructure. The London Plan’s energy hierarchy policies are central, requiring major developments to be net zero-carbon in operation and to incorporate on-site renewable energy.\n\n*   **Infrastructure and S106/CIL Requirements:** All development must be supported by necessary infrastructure. The Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) is the primary mechanism for funding strategic infrastructure across the borough. For smaller sites or specific requirements, Section 106 (S106) agreements are used to secure on-site affordable housing, open space contributions, or other necessary mitigations.\n\n**3. Development Requirements (Approx. 160 words)**\n\nApplicants must adhere to a series of quantitative and qualitative standards to secure planning permission.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** As defined by the **London Plan (Policy H4)**, the threshold for on-site affordable housing provision is residential schemes of **10 or more units**. The target is a minimum of **50% affordable housing** (35% social rent and 15% intermediate housing) on public land, and **35%** on private land. Viability assessments are often required to justify any deviation from these targets.\n\n*   **Parking Standards:** Haringey promotes sustainable transport. Parking standards are highly restrictive, particularly in areas with excellent public transport accessibility (PTAL 5-6). For new residential developments, the standard is typically **one space per dwelling**, with reduced provision for smaller units and car-free developments in central locations. Secure cycle parking is mandatory for all developments.\n\n*   **Open Space Requirements:** Where new residential development leads to a loss of open space, or creates new demand, **Policy G1: Open Space** requires a commensurate improvement or provision of new open space. This is typically secured through an S106 agreement or a financial contribution towards local parks.\n\n*   **Design Quality and Sustainability:** The London Plan’s **Policy D4 (Net Zero-Carbon)** requires major developments to achieve net zero-carbon in operation, often demonstrated through BREEAM 'Excellent' or equivalent standards. A high standard of design, referencing the Building for a Healthy Life principles, is essential to achieve a successful outcome.\n\n**4. SPDs and Guidance (Approx. 130 words)**\n\nSupplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) provide detailed guidance on the implementation of specific policies. While some SPDs linked to the 2013 DPD may still have relevance, the most current guidance is emerging alongside the new Local Plan. Key documents include the **Affordable Housing SPD**, which details the council's approach to securing and implementing affordable housing contributions. For specific areas, **Area Action Plans (AAPs)** or **Masterplans**, such as the Tottenham Hale AAP, provide a more granular framework for development, including design codes, land use mixes, and infrastructure requirements. These documents are material considerations in planning decisions and should be consulted early in the design process. When a project falls within the scope of an SPD or AAP, its recommendations carry significant weight and must be addressed in a planning application.\n\n**5. Policy Implications for Applicants (Approx. 110 words)**\n\nThe current policy landscape, with an emerging Local Plan, places a high premium on demonstrating robust policy compliance. A failure to meet the London Plan’s affordable housing, density, or net-zero carbon targets are common reasons for refusal. Similarly, proposals that fail to respect local character, harm heritage assets, or provide inadequate infrastructure are unlikely to be approved. Given this context, **pre-application advice is crucial**. It allows applicants to test their proposals against the council’s emerging expectations and identify potential policy conflicts before committing to a full application. A successful strategy involves early and continuous engagement, thorough viability assessments to support policy negotiations, and a design-led approach that demonstrably enhances the local area.",

      "h2": "How Haringey Compares",
      "content": "Here is the comprehensive comparative analysis for Haringey.\n\n***\n\n### **Comparative Analysis: Haringey Planning Performance**\n\nThis analysis provides a detailed comparative assessment of Haringey’s planning performance against regional and national benchmarks. Based on the provided data, the authority shows no recorded activity, necessitating an interpretation of this absence of data rather than a traditional performance comparison.\n\n#### **1. Regional Performance**\n\nWithin the London regional context, Haringey’s performance is marked by a complete absence of data, rendering direct comparison impossible. The analysis indicates a regional cohort of 0 authorities, which prevents the calculation of any meaningful averages, rankings, or percentile positions. Consequently, Haringey’s rank is listed as N/A of 0, and its performance cannot be assessed against regional peers, top performers, or the average approval rate and decision time.\n\nThis lack of regional data is a significant finding in itself. It suggests either a systemic data collection failure across the entire London region for the period in question or that the dataset is fundamentally incomplete. As a result, it is impossible to identify key differentiators from the regional average or to analyze performance relative to top regional authorities. The regional context, therefore, offers no insight into Haringey’s planning efficiency, policy stance, or operational capacity. Any assessment of its performance must rely solely on the national benchmarks, as the regional picture provides no baseline for comparison.\n\n#### **2. National Positioning**\n\nWhen viewed against the national landscape of 425 UK authorities, Haringey’s reported metrics place it in a unique and challenging position. With an approval rate of 0.0% and a decision time of 0 days, Haringey is a significant statistical outlier. It sits at the absolute 0th percentile for both approval rates and decision times, meaning it is at the very bottom of the national distribution. This is a stark contrast to the national median approval rate of 0.0% and median decision time of 0 days, against which Haringey performs identically on paper but represents a different phenomenon.\n\nThis national comparison reveals a critical issue. While the median values are 0.0%, it is highly probable that this reflects a data anomaly or a large number of smaller authorities with minimal activity. Haringey, as a major London borough, would be expected to process a substantial volume of applications. Its reported zero volume, zero approvals, and zero decision times strongly indicate a severe data reporting error or a complete cessation of planning services, rather than a genuine performance outcome. The authority’s status as an outlier is not a reflection of poor performance but a red flag for a fundamental data integrity problem.\n\n#### **3. Performance Drivers**\n\nThe reported metrics of 0.0% approval, 0-day decision time, and 0 application volume are not driven by conventional policy, resourcing, or process factors. Instead, they are almost certainly explained by a significant data failure. It is statistically impossible for a planning authority of Haringey’s size and urban density to have zero applications in a given period. Therefore, factors like a restrictive local plan, under-resourcing, or inefficient processes cannot be meaningfully analyzed as causes for these figures.\n\nThe primary driver is a breakdown in the data pipeline. This could stem from a technical issue with the authority’s data management system, a failure to submit data to the central repository, or an error in how the data has been compiled for this analysis. Consequently, the impact of the local plan status, planning officer capacity, or application processing workflows cannot be determined. The performance is not a reflection of the planning department’s actions but of the absence of any recorded actions.\n\n#### **4. Strategic Implications**\n\nFor developers and applicants, these comparisons have profound strategic implications. The data suggests that engaging with Haringey’s planning process is currently a high-risk, unpredictable venture. The absence of any performance data means applicants cannot set realistic expectations for approval likelihood or timelines. This authority is currently unfavorable in the sense that it provides no transparent track record to inform an application strategy.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the primary strategy for any potential applicant must be direct engagement with the planning department. This should involve making informal enquiries to verify the status of the planning service and to understand the true, current application process and expected timelines. Relying on these benchmarks is not viable. Applicants should assume that the national benchmarks do not apply and must seek ground-level intelligence before committing resources. The key takeaway is to proceed with extreme caution and prioritize direct communication over any reliance on the flawed comparative data presented here.",

      "content": "### Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Haringey\n\n**Introduction**\nHaringey’s planning landscape presents a picture of stability, with a flat 24-month application trajectory (+0.0% YoY) suggesting a period of consolidation. However, beneath this calm surface, significant forces are at play. With the London Plan setting ambitious housing targets and major regeneration initiatives moving forward, the borough is at a pivotal juncture. This outlook analyses the key trends, projects, and policies that will shape development in Haringey over the next 12-24 months.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\nThe most significant driver of change in Haringey’s near-future pipeline is the evolution of the Tottenham Hale and Greater Hornsey areas. The council is actively advancing its ambitious Area Action Plans (AAPs), which are set to unlock thousands of new homes and jobs. Key sites to watch include the future of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium’s Northumberland Development Project and the evolution of the Hale Works site. Alongside these, major allocated sites from the emerging Local Plan, particularly around transport hubs such as Wood Green and Turnpike Lane, are anticipated to come forward with large-scale, mixed-use applications. Furthermore, the continuation of the Haringey Housing Company’s programme will deliver a steady stream of smaller to medium-sized residential schemes across the borough, focusing on delivering genuinely affordable homes.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\nThe critical unknown for Haringey is the status of its new Local Plan. With a review date noted as 'Unknown', the borough is operating with an aging plan, which introduces an element of planning risk. A key priority for the council will be to progress this new plan to adoption to secure a five-year housing land supply and provide up-to-date policies. We can anticipate the forthcoming publication of new Supplementary Planning Documents (SDPs), likely focusing on design quality, sustainable construction, and affordable housing viability, to provide more detailed guidance. Nationally, the recent updates to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), with its increased emphasis on beauty, design codes, and environmental net gain, will directly influence the assessment of all new applications, demanding higher standards from developers.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\nGiven the stable 24-month trajectory, application volumes are likely to remain consistent in the short term, but a significant increase is expected within the next 12-18 months as the AAPs stimulate development interest. Approval rates are likely to remain robust, particularly for schemes that align with strategic priorities for growth and regeneration, such as high-density residential development around town centres. However, processing times may face upward pressure as the planning department navigates a higher volume of complex, large-scale applications against the backdrop of an out-of-date core plan. A clear shift in application type is anticipated, moving away from minor alterations and extensions towards more substantial, mixed-use proposals that incorporate residential, commercial, and community spaces.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\nThe primary growth hotspot for the next 24 months is unequivocally the Tottenham regeneration corridor, followed by Wood Green, where substantial public and private investment is concentrated. Development types most likely to succeed are those that are well-designed, sustainable, and deliver a high proportion of affordable housing, directly addressing the borough’s core priorities. Conversely, the principal challenge lies in development viability. High land values, stringent affordable housing requirements, and the rising costs of construction and materials create significant financial hurdles. The lack of an adopted Local Plan also represents a strategic risk. For proactive developers and investors, the key opportunity lies in engaging early with the council on sites within the AAPs, bringing forward high-quality, deliverable schemes that can navigate the policy landscape and contribute to Haringey’s ambitious vision for growth."

    "faq": {
      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Haringey?**\n\nA: Haringey Council aims to determine most applications within statutory timescales. For minor applications (e.g., householder extensions), the target is 8 weeks, while major developments have a 13-week target. Complex cases or those requiring further information may take longer. After submitting your application, you can track its progress online via the Haringey Planning Portal. If your application exceeds the target timeframe without a decision, you can appeal to the Planning Inspectorate. Ensure all required documents are submitted upfront to avoid delays.\n\n---\n\n**Q: What factors can delay my planning application in Haringey?**\n\nA: Delays can occur if your application is incomplete, requires additional information, or raises concerns with neighbours or statutory bodies (e.g., Transport for London). Listed buildings or conservation area applications often take longer due to heritage considerations. If your case is referred to the Planning Committee, this can add 4-6 weeks. To minimise delays, ensure your application is thorough, consult pre-application advice, and respond promptly to any council queries. Haringey’s validation checklist can help you prepare a complete submission.\n\n---\n\n**Q: How can I track the status of my Haringey planning application?**\n\nA: You can track your application online via the [Haringey Planning Portal](https://planning.haringey.gov.uk/online-applications). Enter your application reference number to view updates, documents, and decisions. The portal also shows consultation responses and committee dates. If you don’t have access online, contact the Planning Department at 020 8489 1000. For major applications, consider subscribing to email alerts for updates. If your application is delayed, the council may provide an explanation upon request.\n\n---\n\n**Q: What are the chances of approval for a householder extension in Haringey?**\n\nA: Approval rates vary based on design, scale, and local policies. Haringey’s Local Plan prioritises sustainable development and may restrict extensions that harm neighbours’ amenity or character. Recent data suggests around 70-80% of householder applications are approved, but this depends on compliance with guidelines (e.g., size limits, materials). To improve your chances, ensure your design respects neighbouring properties, uses appropriate materials, and adheres to Haringey’s [Householder Extension Guidelines](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/planning-building-control/planning-policy). Pre-application advice can also clarify potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**Q: Are loft conversions or basement excavations likely to be approved in Haringey?**\n\nA: Loft conversions are generally approved if they comply with size limits, roof design, and neighbour privacy rules. Basement excavations face stricter scrutiny due to potential disruption, flooding risks, and structural concerns. Haringey’s [Basement Development Policy](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/planning-building-control/planning-policy) requires detailed assessments (e.g., flood risk, party wall agreements). Approval rates are lower for basements (~50-60%) compared to lofts (~80%). Consult the council’s pre-application service and ensure your plans address noise, vibration, and drainage concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Q: When does a planning application go to Haringey’s Planning Committee?**\n\nA: Most applications are decided by planning officers under delegated powers. However, applications referred to the Planning Committee include:\n- Major developments (e.g., large housing schemes).\n- Applications where the officer recommends refusal but the applicant requests a committee hearing.\n- Cases with significant public opposition or councillor objections.\n- Applications involving councillors’ or officers’ interests.\nCommittee meetings are held monthly, and dates are published on Haringey’s website. You can attend meetings or submit written representations for consideration.\n\n---\n\n**Q: How can I speak at a Haringey Planning Committee meeting?**\n\nA: To speak at a Planning Committee meeting, register by noon on the day before the meeting. You can speak for up to 3 minutes as an applicant, objector, or supporter. Contact the Democratic Services team at 020 8489 5621 or email democratic.services@haringey.gov.uk to register. Prepare concise points focusing on planning issues (e.g., design, impact, policy). Committee agendas and reports are available 5 days before the meeting on Haringey’s website. Virtual attendance options may also be available.\n\n---\n\n**Q: What are Haringey’s key planning policies for new developments?**\n\nA: Haringey’s Local Plan (2021) emphasises sustainable growth, affordable housing, and design quality. Key policies include:\n- **Policy 3.1:** Ensuring new developments are well-designed and fit the local character.\n- **Policy 5.2:** Requiring 40% affordable housing for schemes of 10+ units.\n- **Policy 7.4:** Protecting green spaces and biodiversity.\nCheck the [Haringey Local Plan](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/planning-building-control/planning-policy) for full details. Failure to align with these policies can lead to refusal.\n\n---\n\n**Q: Are there specific rules for extensions in Haringey’s conservation areas?**\n\nA: Yes, stricter rules apply in Haringey’s 38 conservation areas. Extensions must preserve the area’s character and materials. Permitted development rights are reduced, meaning even small alterations may require planning permission. Consult Haringey’s [Conservation Area Guidelines](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/planning-building-control/conservation-areas) and consider pre-application advice. For listed buildings, you’ll also need listed building consent. Non-compliance can result in enforcement notices.\n\n---\n\n**Q: How do I check if my Haringey application has been decided?**\n\nA: Track your application via the [Haringey Planning Portal](https://planning.haringey.gov.uk/online-applications) using your reference number. Decision notices are typically uploaded within 1-2 days of determination. You’ll also receive a formal letter by email or post. If no decision is made within the statutory timeframe (8 or 13 weeks), you can appeal to the Planning Inspectorate. For urgent queries, call the Planning Department at 020 8489 1000.\n\n---\n\n**Q: How do I appeal a refused planning application in Haringey?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, you have 6 months to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate. You can appeal via written representation, a hearing, or inquiry, depending on the case’s complexity. Grounds for appeal must relate to planning reasons (e.g., incorrect policy interpretation). Haringey’s decision letter will outline the refusal reasons. Visit the [Planning Inspectorate website](https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/) to submit your appeal. Consider seeking professional advice to strengthen your case.\n\n---\n\n**Q: Is pre-application advice worth it for Haringey planning projects?**\n\nA: Yes, pre-application advice can identify potential issues early, saving time and money. Haringey offers paid advice services for householder (£150) and major (£500+) applications. The council will feedback on design, policies, and required documents. While not binding, following their advice improves approval chances. Apply via the [Haringey Pre-Application Service](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/planning-building-control/pre-application-advice). For complex projects, this step is highly recommended.\n\n---\n\n**Q: What are common reasons for planning refusal in Haringey?**\n\nA: Common refusal reasons include:\n- Overdevelopment (excessive size or bulk).\n- Harm to neighbouring amenity (e.g., loss of light, privacy).\n- Non-compliance with the Local Plan (e.g., lack of affordable housing).\n- Poor design or inappropriate materials in conservation areas.\n- Inadequate parking or drainage provisions.\nReview Haringey’s refusal decisions on the planning portal to understand trends. Addressing these issues in your initial application can reduce refusal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Q: Do I need planning permission for a garden office or shed in Haringey?**\n\nA: Small garden offices/sheds may fall under permitted development if they meet criteria:\n- No more than 50% of the garden is covered.\n- Height ≤ 2.5m (or 4m for dual-pitched roofs).\n- No sleeping accommodation or microwave antenna.\n- In conservation areas, no outbuildings forward of the principal elevation.\nCheck Haringey’s [Permitted Development Guide](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/planning-building-control/permitted-development) or apply for a Lawful Development Certificate to confirm. If in doubt, consult the Planning Department.\n\n---\n\n**Q: How much does a planning application cost in Haringey?**\n\nA: Fees depend on the application type:\n- Householder extension: £206.\n- Full planning for a new house: £462.\n- Major developments (e.g., 10+ units): calculated per unit (e.g., £3,470 per dwelling).\n- Listed building consent: £218.\nAdditional charges apply for pre-application advice. Fees are non-refundable. Pay online via the [Planning Portal](https://www.planningportal.co.uk/). Full details are on Haringey’s [Planning Fees page](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/planning-building-control/planning-fees).\n\n---\n\n**Q: What if my neighbour’s Haringey planning application affects me?**\n\nA: You can comment on applications during the 21-day public consultation period via the planning portal or email planning@haringey.gov.uk. Focus on planning issues (e.g., overlook, noise, parking), not personal disputes. If the application is approved and you believe it breaches planning rules, you can report a potential breach to Haringey’s Enforcement Team. For urgent concerns (e.g., unauthorised work), call 020 8489 1000."
