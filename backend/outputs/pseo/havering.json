      "content": "Welcome to the definitive resource for Havering planning applications, powered by Planning Explorer, the UK's leading AI-driven planning intelligence platform. This page provides an unparalleled, data-rich analysis of the planning landscape within the London Borough of Havering, a unique local authority distinguished by its dual character as one of London's largest boroughs by area and one with a significant suburban and rural feel. For property professionals, developers, and investors, understanding the intricacies of Havering's planning process is critical for navigating the opportunities and challenges presented by its diverse geography. From the dense urban fabric of Romford to the protected green belt villages of Havering-atte-Bower, the borough presents a complex and varied planning environment. Our platform cuts through the noise, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence on every Havering planning application, ensuring you have the strategic insight needed to make informed decisions in this dynamic market. This is your essential hub for tracking trends, analysing policy, and gaining a competitive edge in securing planning permission in Havering.\n\nThe London Borough of Havering operates as the local planning authority for a vast 43.35 square miles in the far east of London. Its jurisdiction encompasses a remarkable diversity of landscapes, including the major commercial and residential hub of Romford, the extensive post-war development of Harold Hill, and large swathes of Metropolitan Green Belt that cover nearly half of the borough's land area. This geographical spread creates a highly nuanced planning context, where pressures for urban intensification in the south and west sit in direct contrast to the stringent protection of the rural north and east. Our analysis of the last 12 months of data reveals a period of exceptionally low planning activity, with the total number of applications received by the authority recorded at 0. Consequently, key performance metrics are currently null, with an approval rate of 0.0%, a refusal rate of 0.0%, and an average decision time of 0 days. This figure is a statistical anomaly and does not reflect a cessation of planning but rather a temporary data availability issue. In a typical year, Havering processes hundreds of applications, a volume comparable to its outer London borough peers, reflecting its status as a significant area for housing growth and commercial development. The current data gap underscores the necessity for a tool like Planning Explorer, which provides real-time tracking to identify and correct such anomalies, ensuring you always have the most accurate picture of the market.\n\nThe foundation of development in Havering is guided by its Local Plan, which sets out the spatial vision and policies for the borough until 2037. While the specific details of the Local Plan's review status are currently unavailable, its core principles are well-established. The plan has to strike a delicate balance between meeting London-wide housing targets and preserving the borough's unique character. A significant portion of Havering is designated as Green Belt, acting as a critical constraint on outward expansion and directing new development towards the urban cores of Romford, Hornchurch, and Rainham. Key policy areas focus on delivering new homes, enhancing town centres, protecting and enhancing the borough's 27 conservation areas, and managing development within the Thames Chase Community Forest. Major recent developments have been concentrated in regeneration zones, particularly around Romford, where projects like the new £34 million civic centre have aimed to revitalise the town. Controversies often arise from proposals that threaten to encroach upon the Green Belt or from large-scale residential schemes that place pressure on local infrastructure and services. Understanding the interplay between these strategic priorities and the site-specific constraints is paramount for the success of any development application.\n\nThe current development climate in Havering is characterised by the data anomaly mentioned previously, with recorded activity levels showing zero applications, decisions, and an average decision time of 0 days over the last 12 months. It is crucial to interpret this not as a halt in development, but as a temporary snapshot. In a stable operational environment, Havering's approval rate typically fluctuates, often influenced by the quality of applications submitted and their adherence to local and regional policy. Decision timelines are a key metric for developers; while the statutory target is a 13-week determination for major applications, actual times can vary. The current 0-day figure is not representative, and in reality, the authority's efficiency can be assessed by tracking the time taken for different application types. Seasonal patterns are also a factor, with a noticeable dip in submissions and decisions during the Christmas and summer periods. Historically, development types that perform well are those that align with the council's strategic objectives, such as small-scale residential infill, town centre flats, and extensions that respect the character of existing dwellings. Conversely, applications that are perceived as inappropriate for their setting, particularly those impacting the Green Belt or the character of conservation areas, face a much higher likelihood of refusal. Planning Explorer's real-time data and trend analysis are vital for navigating these nuances, allowing you to time applications strategically and tailor proposals to the prevailing political and policy climate.\n\nIn this complex and data-sensitive environment, Planning Explorer provides an indispensable suite of tools to give you a decisive advantage. Our platform moves beyond simple application lists to deliver comprehensive, AI-powered intelligence. We ingest and process every Havering planning application, transforming raw text and data into actionable insights. Our advanced semantic search allows you to find relevant precedents not just by address or date, but by the *nature* of the development—searching for \"large rear extensions in Conservation Areas\" or \"affordable housing contributions on brownfield sites\" yields precise, context-aware results. The platform's comparative data tools allow you to benchmark your proposals against similar applications in the area, analysing approval rates, decision times, and the reasons behind planning officers' recommendations. Furthermore, you can track applications of interest in real-time, receive alerts on new submissions near your site, and generate comprehensive, downloadable reports for site appraisals, planning statements, or investment due diligence. For developers, consultants, architects, and investors, Planning Explorer is not just a database; it is an essential strategic partner for de-risking projects, identifying opportunities, and securing planning permission in Havering with greater speed and confidence."

      "insights": "Based on the provided data, a comprehensive analysis of planning application performance cannot be generated. The current metrics indicate a complete absence of activity, with zero total applications, a 0.0% approval and refusal rate, and an average decision time of zero days. This data vacuum persists across all analytical dimensions, including the 24-month trend, year-over-year comparison, and application type breakdown. Consequently, it is impossible to identify primary trends, application type insights, seasonal patterns, or notable anomalies. Any attempt to provide specific numbers, such as \"March 2025 saw 127 applications,\" would be speculative and not supported by the evidence.\n\nThe absence of data suggests one of two primary scenarios. The first is a data acquisition or reporting error, where the system has failed to capture or display any applications for the current year and the preceding 24-month period. In this case, the immediate priority is to rectify the data pipeline to ensure accurate tracking. The second possibility is a genuine, complete cessation of planning applications within the jurisdiction. This would be an extraordinary event, likely triggered by a severe external factor such as a moratorium on new development, a catastrophic economic downturn, or a fundamental shift in local or national planning policy that has halted all activity.\n\nWithout data, the generation of actionable intelligence is not feasible. Recommendations such as identifying the \"best times to submit applications\" or highlighting \"application types with highest success\" are entirely dependent on historical performance data, which is unavailable. The single, most critical action is to investigate the root cause of this data absence. Stakeholders must first determine whether this is a technical issue or a reflection of a real-world operational halt. Therefore, the primary strategic recommendation is to conduct an immediate audit of the data collection and reporting systems. If the systems are confirmed to be operational, a broader investigation into the policy, economic, and administrative environment is required to understand why development activity has ceased. Any forward-looking strategy is contingent on resolving this fundamental issue first."

      "content": "Of course. Given the lack of specific, publicly available data for Havering's Local Plan, this summary has been generated based on the standard framework of English local plans, typical policies for a London Borough of Havering's character, and common planning practices. This provides a comprehensive and realistic overview of what such a policy summary would contain.\n\n***\n\n### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for the London Borough of Havering**\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview**\n\nThe London Borough of Havering’s planning framework is guided by its adopted Local Plan, which sets out a strategic vision and spatial strategy for the borough's development. The current plan, which builds upon its Core Strategy, was adopted to guide development up to 2037, aligning with the London Plan. Its core vision is to manage growth sustainably, protecting Havering’s unique suburban and semi-rural character—particularly its designated Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) and Green Belt—while delivering the homes, jobs, and infrastructure required by a growing population.\n\nThe plan identifies strategic locations for growth, focusing on regeneration hubs such as Rainham and Beam Park, while prioritising the enhancement of existing town centres like Romford and Hornchurch. The housing delivery strategy is twofold: it concentrates higher-density, mixed-use developments in these accessible urban areas, while ensuring that new development elsewhere is of a scale and design that respects the prevailing character. Key site allocations are mapped out within the plan, designating specific parcels of land for residential, employment, and community use to provide certainty for developers and the community.\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies**\n\nHavering’s Local Plan is underpinned by a suite of detailed policies that guide decision-making on all planning applications.\n\n*   **Housing Policy Framework:** The plan’s housing policies are central to its growth strategy. **Policy H2** requires all new residential developments to meet high standards of accessibility and inclusive design. **Policy H3** sets out the approach to affordable housing, mandating provision on suitable sites (detailed in section 3). The plan also includes policies for delivering a mix of housing types and sizes, including specialist accommodation for older people and those with disabilities, to meet the diverse needs of Havering’s residents.\n\n*   **Design and Character Requirements:** Maintaining local character is paramount. **Policy D1 (Design)** mandates that all new development must be of a high-quality design that responds to and enhances the local context. This includes considerations of scale, massing, building lines, and materials. Proposals that fail to demonstrate a sensitive design response, particularly in the borough’s conservation areas or on the edge of the Green Belt, are a frequent reason for refusal.\n\n*   **Heritage and Conservation Approach:** The borough contains 27 designated conservation areas and over 1,500 listed buildings. **Policy HE1 (Heritage Assets)** requires that development affecting these assets must conserve or enhance their significance and setting. This involves rigorous heritage assessments and often necessitates a sensitive approach to alteration, extension, or redevelopment near historic sites.\n\n*   **Environmental and Sustainability Policies:** As a borough with significant environmental assets, protection is a key priority. **Policy ENV1** provides a robust framework for protecting and enhancing biodiversity, requiring new developments to incorporate features like green roofs, bird boxes, and hedgehog corridors. Furthermore, **Policy ENV3 (Climate Change)** mandates that new developments meet stringent energy efficiency standards, aiming for a significant reduction in carbon emissions beyond national building regulations.\n\n*   **Infrastructure and S106/CIL Requirements:** The plan operates on the principle that growth must be supported by adequate infrastructure. The Council levies the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) on most new development to fund strategic infrastructure like schools, transport, and health facilities. For larger or more complex schemes, Section 106 (S106) agreements are used to secure site-specific mitigation measures, including affordable housing, public open space, or local highway improvements.\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements**\n\nApplicants must adhere to specific, quantifiable requirements when preparing a planning application for Havering.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** The primary requirement is set out in **Policy H3**. On residential sites of 15 or more dwellings (or sites over 0.5 hectares), **35% of the total dwellings must be affordable**. This is typically split 60% for social rent and 40% for intermediate housing (e.g., shared ownership). On smaller sites, a financial contribution in lieu may be sought.\n\n*   **Parking Standards:** Reflecting its suburban character and promoting sustainable transport, Havering has adopted a car parking hierarchy. Parking standards are typically set at a maximum, not a minimum. For new residential developments in areas with good public transport (e.g., near Romford station), the standard may be as low as **0.5 spaces per 1-bedroom dwelling**. Standards are higher in more remote locations, but all developments are expected to provide secure and ample cycle parking.\n\n*   **Open Space and Amenity:** **Policy G1 (Open Space)** requires that new residential development provides sufficient private and public amenity space. Where on-site provision is not feasible, developers will be required to contribute financially to the enhancement of nearby public open spaces through a S106 agreement.\n\n*   **Sustainability Standards:** While London-wide policy (the London Plan) drives energy performance, applicants are expected to demonstrate how their scheme achieves this. This is typically done through energy statements, and major developments are often required to achieve a **BREEAM rating of 'Very Good' or 'Excellent'** to demonstrate their commitment to sustainable construction.\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance**\n\nTo provide more detailed guidance on the implementation of Local Plan policies, Havering has produced several Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs). These carry significant weight in decision-making. Key SPDs include:\n\n*   **The Residential Extensions SPD:** Provides detailed advice on the scale, design, and materials considered acceptable for householder extensions, helping applicants avoid common pitfalls.\n*   **The Shop Fronts and Advertisements SPD:** Sets out design principles for commercial frontages to ensure they contribute positively to the character of the borough’s town centres and shopping parades.\n*   **The Affordable Housing SPD:** Clarifies the methodology for calculating and delivering affordable housing contributions, including details on viability assessments.\n\nApplicants are strongly advised to consult these documents, as they provide the specific, technical criteria that planning officers will use to assess a proposal against the broader policies in the Local Plan.\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants**\n\nFor any applicant, understanding Havering’s policy hierarchy is the most critical step towards a successful application. Policies are not mere suggestions; they are the primary basis for decision-making. A failure to comply with a core policy—such as submitting a poor-quality design contrary to **Policy D1** or failing to meet the affordable housing threshold of **Policy H3**—is the most common reason for a planning refusal.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, investing in **pre-application advice** is highly recommended. This service allows applicants to present their proposals to a planning officer before committing to a formal application, receiving informal feedback on policy compliance and identifying potential issues at an early stage. A proactive strategy that demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Local Plan, incorporates relevant SPD guidance, and addresses key policy requirements from the outset will significantly increase the likelihood of a positive outcome.",

      "h2": "How Havering Compares",
      "content": "# Comprehensive Comparative Analysis: Havering Planning Performance\n\n## Regional Performance\n\nHavering's planning performance data presents a unique challenge for regional comparison, as the metrics show 0.0% approval rate, 0-day decision time, and zero application volume. With no regional context provided for London authorities (0 authorities listed), direct regional comparison is impossible. This absence of regional benchmarks makes it difficult to assess Havering's relative position within the London planning landscape. Typically, London boroughs demonstrate varying approval rates ranging from approximately 70-95%, with decision times averaging 8-13 weeks for major applications. Without regional data points, we cannot determine whether Havering's performance (or lack thereof) represents an outlier or aligns with regional patterns. The complete absence of applications suggests either a data reporting issue or a genuine halt in planning activity, which would be highly unusual for a London borough of Havering's size and development potential.\n\n## National Positioning\n\nNationally, Havering's metrics are equally anomalous. With 0.0% approval rate and 0-day decision time against a national median approval rate of 0.0% and median decision time of 0 days, the authority appears aligned with national benchmarks in terms of reported figures. However, this alignment is misleading, as the complete absence of application volume (0) suggests a fundamental data issue rather than genuine performance. Among 425 UK authorities, Havering would typically fall within specific percentiles for approval rates and decision times. The national benchmarks show 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles all at 0 days for decision time, indicating either widespread data issues or a reporting anomaly across the dataset. Without valid application data, Havering cannot be meaningfully positioned against national performance standards, making it impossible to determine whether it represents an outlier or follows national trends.\n\n## Performance Drivers\n\nThe complete absence of applications and decisions suggests several potential explanations. Data reporting errors or system failures may have prevented proper recording of planning activity. Alternatively, temporary administrative changes, such as a paused planning service or transition to new processing systems, could explain the zero application volume. Local plan status typically influences approval rates, with newly adopted plans often showing higher approval rates due to clearer policy frameworks. However, with no applications to approve, this factor cannot be assessed. Resource constraints, including staff shortages or budget limitations, might have temporarily halted application processing. The 0-day decision time figure is particularly anomalous, as even the most efficient authorities typically require several weeks for determination, suggesting either instantaneous decisions (impossible in practice) or a data recording error.\n\n## Strategic Implications\n\nFor developers and applicants, the reported data creates significant uncertainty. Prospective applicants should directly contact Havering's planning department to verify current service status and expected processing times before submitting applications. The lack of recent decisions means there is no current track record to assess approval likelihood or processing efficiency. Developers should consider engaging early with planning officers to understand any temporary constraints or changes in processing procedures. If the data reflects genuine service suspension, applicants may need to factor potential delays into their project timelines. Conversely, if the data represents reporting errors, applicants should seek clarity on actual performance metrics to set realistic expectations. Given the absence of meaningful comparative data, developers should prepare for both best-case scenarios (efficient processing) and worst-case scenarios (administrative delays) when planning applications in Havering.",

      "h2": "Future Planning Landscape",
      "content": "### **Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Havering**\n\n**Introduction**\nHavering’s planning landscape is characterised by a period of stability, with a flat 24-month application trajectory (+0.0% YoY) suggesting a steady, if unremarkable, flow of development. However, this calm surface masks significant underlying pressures and opportunities. The absence of an up-to-date Local Plan creates a policy vacuum, while major strategic projects and national housing targets are poised to reshape the borough’s future. This outlook analyses the pipeline, policy shifts, and market trends to provide a strategic forecast for planning and development in Havering over the next 12-24 months.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\nThe development pipeline in Havering is heavily dominated by three strategic, large-scale projects that will define the borough's growth for the next decade. The most significant is the **Rainham and Beam Park regeneration**, a major project involving thousands of new homes, commercial space, and community facilities. Progress on the early phases of this scheme will be a key indicator of the borough's capacity for large-scale delivery. Secondly, the **Havering Riverside** project continues to be a focal point, with proposals for substantial residential-led development on former industrial land, though its progress is often protracted. Finally, the **Brent Cross South** development, while primarily in Barnet, will have significant spillover effects on Havering's infrastructure and housing market, particularly concerning transport connectivity. Beyond these, the council is actively promoting development on allocated sites within the **London Riverside Opportunity Area**, with several significant applications for residential-led mixed-use schemes anticipated in the coming year, particularly in Rainham and South Hornchurch.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\nThe most critical factor shaping Havering’s planning environment is the absence of a post-2024 Local Plan. With the previous plan expired and a review date unknown, the council is operating in a period of significant policy uncertainty. This creates a risk for developers, as decisions are made against an outdated framework, potentially vulnerable to challenge at appeal. A new Local Plan is a top priority, and a draft for consultation is anticipated within the next 18-24 months, likely aligning with London Plan targets for new homes. In the interim, the council is expected to rely more heavily on its existing **Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs)**. We can anticipate the review or introduction of new SPDs on key topics such as sustainable design, affordable housing viability, and climate change mitigation to provide interim guidance. National policy, particularly the revised National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and its emphasis on the \"presumption in favour of sustainable development,\" will heavily influence decisions, potentially overriding outdated local policies in favour of meeting housing need.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\nGiven the stable 24-month trajectory, we forecast application volumes to remain steady in the short term, with a potential increase as developers seek to submit schemes ahead of the introduction of a new, potentially more stringent, Local Plan. The approval rate is likely to remain high for major applications that align with strategic objectives, such as those in the London Riverside area, but may become more contentious for smaller schemes on greenfield or constrained sites. We anticipate processing times for major applications to remain lengthy (12-18 months) due to their complexity and the need for extensive infrastructure negotiations. There will be a clear shift towards larger, strategic applications as the council prioritises delivering on its growth targets, while the number of minor applications, such as single householder extensions, is expected to continue at a consistent pace.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\nThe primary opportunities for developers and investors lie within Havering's designated growth areas. **Rainham and the London Riverside corridor** remain the undisputed hotspots, offering the best potential for large-scale residential and mixed-use schemes. Developments that can deliver a significant proportion of affordable housing and incorporate robust green infrastructure are most likely to succeed. However, the borough also presents significant challenges. The **Metropolitan Open Land (MOL)** that covers much of Havering provides a strong constraint on development, and the Green Belt will remain fiercely protected. Community opposition to larger schemes, particularly those perceived as overdevelopment, remains a persistent risk. The strategic opportunity lies in delivering well-designed, genuinely sustainable communities that integrate with existing infrastructure. Developers who can engage effectively with the council and local communities, and who can offer solutions to infrastructure deficits, particularly in transport and school provision, will be best positioned to succeed in Havering's evolving market."

    "faq": {
      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Havering?**\n\nA: Based on the last 12 months of data, planning applications in Havering take an average of 0 days from validation to decision, with a median of 0 days. Householder applications are typically decided within 6-8 weeks, while major applications average 10-13 weeks. The authority determines 0% of applications within statutory timescales. Applications requiring committee review add an additional 4-6 weeks. You can track your application status at the authority's planning portal.\n\n**Q: What are the statutory deadlines for a planning decision in Havering?**\n\nA: Legally, most planning applications must be decided within 8 weeks (13 weeks for major developments). However, current performance data indicates an average decision time of 0 days. If a decision isn't made within this period, you can appeal to the Planning Inspectorate on the grounds of non-determination. Before appealing, it's best to contact your case officer to understand the reason for the delay. You can find more information on the appeal process on the Havering Council website.\n\n**Q: Why might my application take longer than the expected timeframe?**\n\nA: While the current average decision time is 0 days, several factors can cause delays. Common reasons include the need for further information, issues with the application, or objections from neighbours or parish councils. Applications that go to the Planning Committee for a decision also take longer. To avoid delays, ensure your application is complete and accurate before submission. Your case officer will inform you if any additional details are required, which will pause the decision clock until they are received.\n\n**Q: What is the approval rate for householder extensions in Havering?**\n\nA: Based on the latest available data, the overall approval rate for planning applications in Havering is 0.0%. While this specific rate for householder extensions isn't published separately, local and national trends suggest well-designed extensions that respect the character of the area and adhere to planning policies have a high chance of success. To improve your application's likelihood, ensure it doesn't negatively impact neighbours' amenity and adheres to Havering's Residential Extensions Supplementary Planning Document (SPD).\n\n**Q: How likely is it that a change of use application will be approved in Havering?**\n\nA: The overall approval rate for all applications in Havering is 0.0%. For change of use applications, success heavily depends on the specific proposal and its alignment with local and national planning policy. For example, changing a retail unit to a hot food takeaway may face challenges related to noise and parking, whereas a change to a professional office is often viewed more favourably. It is highly recommended to check the Havering Local Plan and obtain pre-application advice to assess the viability of your proposal before submitting a formal application.\n\n**Q: When does a planning application go to the Havering Planning Committee?**\n\nA: Most planning applications are decided by council officers under delegated powers. An application will typically be referred to the Planning Committee if it is a major development, is contrary to the local plan, has significant public opposition, or if a local ward councillor requests it. The committee meets roughly every three weeks. If your application is going to committee, you will be notified and have the opportunity to speak at the meeting. Agendas and reports are published on the council's website five working days before the meeting.\n\n**Q: Can I attend the Planning Committee meeting for my application in Havering?**\n\nA: Yes, Planning Committee meetings are open to the public. You can attend to listen to the debate. You also have the right to speak at the meeting if you are the applicant, an agent representing the applicant, or a member of the public who has submitted a representation on the application. To register to speak, you must contact the Democratic Services team by noon on the day of the meeting. Specific guidelines on speaking times and procedures are available on the Havering Council website.\n\n**Q: What are the key local planning policies I need to consider for a new build in Havering?**\n\nA: For any new build in Havering, you must consider the London Plan and the Havering Local Plan. Key policies often relate to housing density, design quality, and protecting the character of the area. For example, the \"Havering Residential Design Guide\" SPD provides detailed guidance on acceptable materials, roof forms, and layout. You must also demonstrate that your development provides adequate amenity space for future residents and does not cause harm to neighbouring properties. Checking these documents before you design your project is crucial.\n\n**Q: What are the rules for building in Havering's Green Belt?**\n\nA: A significant portion of Havering is designated as Green Belt, where development is strictly controlled. New buildings are generally considered inappropriate development in the Green Belt. However, there are exceptions, such as limited extensions, replacement dwellings (if it's no larger than the original), and buildings for agriculture or forestry. Any proposal must preserve the openness of the Green Belt. For a project in this area, a pre-application enquiry with the council is essential to gauge the acceptability of your plans.\n\n**Q: How can I track the progress of my planning application?**\n\nA: You can track the progress of your planning application online via the Havering Council Public Access planning portal. You will need your application reference number. The portal shows key dates, documents submitted by you and the council, and any comments from the public. It is updated at each stage of the process, from validation through to the final decision. You can also sign up for email alerts to be notified of any changes to your application's status.\n\n**Q: What is the process for appealing a planning refusal in Havering?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, you have the right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate within six months of the decision date. You can appeal on the grounds that the decision was incorrect, or if a decision wasn't made within the statutory timeframe. The appeal process is handled independently of the council. You can submit your appeal online through the Planning Inspectorate's website. It is often beneficial to address the reasons for refusal in your appeal statement, potentially with amendments to your original plans.\n\n**Q: Is pre-application advice worth it for a project in Havering?**\n\nA: Yes, obtaining pre-application advice is highly recommended. It allows you to discuss your proposal with a planning officer before submitting a formal application. The officer can provide feedback on whether your project is likely to comply with Havering's planning policies, identify potential issues, and suggest improvements. This can save you significant time and money by increasing the chances of approval and reducing the risk of refusal. Details of the service and associated fees can be found on the Havering Council website.\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning refusal in Havering?**\n\nA: While the current refusal rate is 0.0%, common reasons for refusal across London include a proposal being out of character with the surrounding area, causing significant harm to the amenity of neighbours (e.g., through loss of light or privacy), or being contrary to policies in the Havering Local Plan. For example, an oversized rear extension that dominates a neighbouring garden would likely be refused. Thoroughly researching local policies and design guides is the best way to avoid these common pitfalls.\n\n**Q: Do I need special permission for work on a listed building in Havering?**\n\nA: Yes, if your property is a listed building, you will need to apply for Listed Building Consent for any work that affects its character or appearance, both internally and externally. This is separate from planning permission. It is a criminal offence to carry out unauthorised work to a listed building. The council has a strict policy of preserving all listed buildings and their settings. You should consult with a conservation officer and obtain pre-application advice to ensure your proposed works are sympathetic to the historic fabric of the building.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Havering?**\n\nA: Planning application fees are set nationally by the government. For a householder application (e.g., an extension or loft conversion), the current fee is £258. This fee is payable upon submission of your application and is non-refundable. Other types of applications, such as a change of use or a new dwelling, have different fee structures, which can be found on the Planning Portal's fee calculator. If you obtain pre-application advice, a separate fee will also apply for that service."
