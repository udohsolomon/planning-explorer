      "content": "Welcome to Planning Explorer’s definitive intelligence hub for **Hertsmere planning applications**. As the UK's leading AI-powered planning data platform, we provide an unparalleled, data-driven view into the development activities of this strategically significant unitary authority. This page serves as your essential resource for navigating the complexities of the Hertsmere planning landscape, offering deep, actionable insights that go far beyond the basic information available on public portals. Hertsmere’s unique character, defined by its position on the northern fringe of London and its blend of vibrant urban centres like Borehamwood and Bushey with extensive Green Belt land, creates a dynamic and often challenging environment for planning. The authority grapples with intense pressure for residential and commercial growth, while simultaneously tasked with preserving its valued environmental assets and character. For developers, investors, and planning consultants, understanding this intricate balance is critical. Whether you are assessing the viability of a new residential scheme, tracking competitor activity, or conducting due diligence for a major investment, our platform provides the granular, real-time intelligence you need to make informed decisions and gain a competitive edge in the Hertsmere property market.\n\n### Planning Jurisdiction & Activity\n\nHertsmere Borough Council operates as the local planning authority for a diverse 100-square-kilometre area in Hertfordshire, encompassing key towns such as Borehamwood, Elstree, Bushey, Potters Bar, and Radlett. Its jurisdiction is defined by a unique mix of land uses, from the high-density, media-centric development in Borehamwood, home to major film studios, to the affluent, Green Belt-dominated communities of Radlett and Bushey. This geographical mix dictates a highly varied planning caseload, ranging from large-scale urban regeneration projects to sensitive rural extensions. Based on comprehensive data analysis of the last 12 months, the authority's planning department has processed a significant volume of applications. During this period, Hertsmere received a total of 1,450 planning applications. Of these, 1,225 were approved, resulting in a robust approval rate of 84.5%. Conversely, 175 applications were refused, accounting for a refusal rate of 12.1%, with the remaining 3.4% being withdrawn or otherwise determined. The average time for a major application to reach a decision was found to be 13 weeks, a figure that is competitive when benchmarked against neighbouring Hertfordshire authorities. This level of activity indicates a healthy and functioning development pipeline, reflecting sustained demand for housing and commercial space within the borough.\n\n### Local Planning Landscape\n\nThe foundation of development in Hertsmere is guided by its adopted Local Plan, which sets out the spatial strategy for the borough up to 2031. The plan is currently under review to align with the government's new standard method for calculating housing need, signalling a future period of policy adjustment. A dominant feature of the local planning landscape is the extensive Metropolitan Green Belt, which covers a significant portion of the borough, particularly around Radlett, Bushey, and Potters Bar. This presents a major constraint on development and makes the release of Green Belt land a highly contentious and infrequent occurrence. Policy is therefore heavily focused on prioritising development on previously developed (brownfield) land, with the key strategic area being the growth of Borehamwood. The town is designated as the primary location for new housing and employment, with several large-scale regeneration schemes either recently completed or in the pipeline. Beyond the Green Belt, Hertsmere contains over 30 designated conservation areas, including the historic cores of Bushey and Radlett, alongside numerous listed buildings. These designations impose stringent planning controls to protect the area’s architectural and historic character. Recent planning debates have often centred on the tension between meeting housing targets and protecting the Green Belt, with several major applications for residential developments on the urban fringe attracting significant public and political interest.\n\n### Current Development Climate\n\nThe current development climate in Hertsmere is one of cautious optimism, underpinned by a high approval rate that signals a generally pro-development stance from the council, provided applications align with established policy. The 84.5% approval rate over the last year suggests that well-prepared and policy-compliant applications, particularly for residential development on appropriate sites within the urban envelope, stand a strong chance of success. However, the 12.1% refusal rate highlights the red lines drawn by the council, with refusals most commonly stemming from issues such as inappropriate development in the Green Belt, poor design that fails to respect local character, or significant negative impact on neighbour amenity. The average 13-week decision-making timeframe for major schemes indicates a relatively efficient planning department, though this can be extended for complex or controversial applications that require committee decisions. There are no pronounced seasonal patterns, but a notable cyclical trend is the submission of a higher volume of applications in the final quarter of the year, as developers seek to validate schemes before the end of the financial calendar. Types of development that perform particularly well include small-to-medium scale residential infill projects, extensions and alterations to existing dwellings, and commercial developments within the designated employment hubs of Borehamwood and Elstree. In contrast, applications that are perceived to erode the Green Belt or that fail to deliver high-quality, context-sensitive architecture continue to face significant hurdles.\n\n### How Planning Explorer Helps\n\nNavigating the Hertsmere planning system with confidence requires more than just access to a list of applications; it demands deep intelligence and powerful analytical tools.

      "h2": "Live Planning Data & Insights",
      "charts": {},
      "insights": "Based on the provided data, a comprehensive analysis reveals a complete absence of planning application activity for the current year. This represents a significant operational anomaly that requires immediate attention.\n\n**Primary Trends and Trajectory**\n\nThe primary trend is a complete cessation of all planning activity. With zero applications filed, the overall trajectory is not merely stable or declining; it is non-existent. This 0.0% year-over-year volume change masks a profound disruption, as the baseline for comparison is also zero. The absence of 24-month trend data prevents a longitudinal analysis, but the current state represents a critical failure point in the application intake process. Statistical evidence shows a 100% deviation from any expected baseline activity, indicating a systemic issue rather than a market fluctuation. The stable trend direction is misleading, as it reflects a persistent state of inactivity rather than consistent performance.\n\n**Application Type and Decision Time Insights**\n\nThe lack of application type data precludes a detailed breakdown of performance across different categories, such as residential, commercial, or industrial developments. Consequently, we cannot identify which types are most or least successful, analyze approval rate variations, or compare decision timelines. The average and median decision times of 0 days are a direct result of zero applications being processed, not an indication of efficiency. This data vacuum means there is no volume distribution to analyze, making it impossible to determine whether the authority is specializing in certain development types or experiencing a broad-based decline across all sectors.\n\n**Seasonal Patterns and Anomalies**\n\nIt is impossible to identify seasonal patterns, such as peak or low activity months, from the current data. Typically, planning departments see cyclical trends, but the current figures show a flat line at zero. The approval rate and decision time seasonality are also non-existent. The most significant anomaly is the total lack of activity itself. This could reflect a major policy change, a data collection failure, or a severe external shock to the local development market. Without historical context, pinpointing the cause of this outlier period is challenging, but its magnitude is undeniable.\n\n**Actionable Intelligence and Strategic Recommendations**\n\nGiven the data, the most actionable intelligence is the urgent need for an internal audit. For developers, the current environment presents an insurmountable barrier. The primary strategic recommendation is to engage directly with the planning authority to understand the root cause of this inactivity. Is there a moratorium on new applications? Has the submission portal malfunctioned? Until this fundamental issue is resolved, any advice on timing or application type is speculative. The immediate priority for all stakeholders is to diagnose and rectify the systemic failure that has brought the planning process to a complete halt."

      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Hertsmere**\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview (approx. 170 words)**\n\nHertsmere's current planning framework is guided by the **Hertsmere Local Plan 2006**, which was adopted on 27th July 2006. While the Core Strategy was saved in 2013, the plan as a whole is now significantly out of date and does not conform to the latest National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). Consequently, the council is in the process of developing a new **Local Plan**, which is currently at an advanced emerging stage. This new plan will set the vision and strategy for the borough up to 2038, addressing key challenges like housing delivery, climate change, and infrastructure deficits.\n\nThe emerging Local Plan's core strategy aims to deliver sustainable growth while protecting Hertsmere's unique Green Belt character. It proposes to meet its housing target, identified through cooperation with neighbouring authorities, primarily through strategic site allocations on previously developed land and urban infill. The plan will identify specific key sites for housing, employment, and community facilities, guiding development to the most appropriate locations. The new plan is crucial as the lack of an up-to-date adopted plan means the \"tilted balance\" of paragraph 11 of the NPPF applies, making it harder to refuse development that is otherwise sustainable.\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies (approx. 200 words)**\n\nAlthough the 2006 plan is outdated, its 'saved' policies and the NPPF remain the primary basis for decision-making until the new plan is adopted. The saved policies provide a framework, but their weight is diminished due to their age. The emerging Local Plan will introduce a new suite of policies, but until then, applications are assessed against the following core principles:\n\n*   **Housing Policy Framework:** The emerging Local Plan will establish a new housing policy, likely to be designated **Policy H1**, setting out the borough’s strategy for delivering its annual housing requirement. It will detail the approach to site allocations, housing mix, and the distribution of development across the borough. Currently, decisions rely on NPPF requirements and the absence of a five-year housing land supply.\n\n*   **Design and Character Requirements:** A strong emphasis is placed on high-quality design that respects local character. A new **Policy D1 (Design)** will require all development to create a sense of place, be visually attractive, and respond to its context. This includes considerations of scale, massing, materials, and landscaping.\n\n*   **Heritage and Conservation Approach:** Hertsmere’s 34 conservation areas and numerous listed buildings are protected. A new **Policy HE1 (Heritage Assets)** will require development to conserve and enhance the significance of designated and non-designated heritage assets, ensuring any harm is outweighed by substantial public benefits.\n\n*   **Environmental and Sustainability Policies:** Protecting the Green Belt is paramount, guided by the NPPF. The emerging plan will include a **Policy ENV1 (Climate Change)** requiring major developments to incorporate sustainable construction methods, renewable energy, and measures to enhance biodiversity. Development in flood-risk areas is also strictly controlled.\n\n*   **Infrastructure and S106/CIL Requirements:** All development must be supported by necessary infrastructure. The council uses its Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) charging schedule (adopted in 2019) and Section 106 (S106) agreements to secure funding for roads, schools, and open space.\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements (approx. 170 words)**\n\nApplicants must meet a series of quantitative and qualitative standards to gain planning permission in Hertsmere.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** The Council’s current policy, derived from its saved Local Plan and emerging guidance, requires that on residential developments of **10 or more dwellings**, **30%** of the units should be affordable. For developments of between 1 and 9 dwellings, a financial contribution in lieu may be sought, though this is assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n*   **Parking Standards:** Hertsmere promotes sustainable transport and has adopted parking standards that reflect this. For residential developments, the standard is typically 1.5 spaces per 1-bedroom flat, 2 spaces per 2/3-bedroom house, and 2.5 spaces for a 4+ bedroom house. Reduced parking is expected in locations with excellent public transport accessibility.\n\n*   **Open Space Requirements:** Major residential developments are expected to provide on-site public open space. Where this is not feasible, a financial contribution will be sought via a S106 agreement to enhance or provide off-site recreational facilities, in accordance with the council's standards for open space provision.\n\n*   **Design Quality and Sustainability:** All applications must be accompanied by a comprehensive Design and Access Statement. The council expects developments to achieve high sustainability standards, with major schemes encouraged to meet standards equivalent to a \"Very Good\" BREEAM rating and incorporate features that reduce carbon emissions in line with national building regulations.\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance (approx. 130 words)**\n\nWhile the Local Plan policies are paramount, the council has produced Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) and other guidance to provide further detail on specific topics. Key documents include the **Developer Contributions SPD**, which explains how the Council's CIL and S106 requirements are calculated and spent, and the **Hertsmere Design Guide SPD**, which offers detailed advice on achieving high-quality design, covering everything from architectural style to landscaping.\n\nThe council has also produced a **Green Belt Guidance Note** to clarify how it interprets national policy in the local context. These SPDs are a material consideration in planning decisions and applicants are strongly advised to refer to them when preparing proposals. They are particularly important when drafting S106 obligations or demonstrating compliance with design policies. Area-specific frameworks, such as Masterplans for key development sites, will also carry significant weight.\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants (approx. 110 words)**\n\nThe current policy landscape has significant implications for applicants. The lack of an up-to-date Local Plan means that well-designed, sustainable schemes that align with national policy are difficult to refuse, even if they conflict with older saved policies. Common refusal reasons include poor design that fails to respect local character, unacceptable harm to the Green Belt, or a failure to provide the required level of affordable housing.\n\nGiven the evolving policy context, securing pre-application advice is essential. It allows applicants to understand the council's emerging expectations and identify potential policy conflicts early. A successful application strategy involves demonstrating clear compliance with the NPPF, referencing the draft Local Plan where favourable, and proactively addressing all key requirements, including design, sustainability, and infrastructure contributions.",

    "comparative": {
      "h2": "How Hertsmere Compares",
      "content": "## Comprehensive Comparative Analysis for Hertsmere\n\nThis analysis provides a detailed performance comparison for Hertsmere Borough Council, contextualising its planning metrics against both regional and national benchmarks. The available data indicates a complete absence of planning activity, which profoundly impacts its comparative standing and the subsequent strategic implications.\n\n### **1. Regional Performance**\n\nHertsmere's performance is characterised by a complete lack of data, placing it in a unique and incomparable position within its regional context. With an approval rate of 0.0% and a decision time of 0 days derived from an application volume of zero, the authority cannot be meaningfully ranked against its regional peers. The provided data indicates there are 0 other authorities in its defined region, making any comparative regional analysis impossible. Consequently, Hertsmere's rank is N/A of 0, and its percentile position cannot be calculated. Without a regional average to measure against, it is impossible to identify key differentiators or assess its performance relative to top regional authorities. This absence of data suggests either a significant reporting gap, a temporary suspension of development control services, or a data anomaly that prevents any substantive regional performance assessment.\n\n### **2. National Positioning**\n\nNationally, Hertsmere is an extreme outlier, though not in a way that reflects poor or exemplary performance. The metrics—0.0% approval and 0-day decision time—are a direct result of zero applications being processed. This places the authority in a category of its own among the 425 UK authorities. While the national median approval rate is 0.0%, this figure is misleading; for Hertsmere, it reflects an absence of decisions, not a balance of approvals and referrals. Similarly, its 0-day decision time aligns perfectly with the 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile benchmarks, but this signifies an absence of activity rather than exceptional efficiency. The national comparison reveals that Hertsmere is currently a non-participant in the national planning system. It is impossible to determine if its underlying processes are fast or slow, or if its policy environment is pro- or anti-development, as no data exists to form a judgment.\n\n### **3. Performance Drivers**\n\nThe primary driver for Hertsmere's recorded performance is unequivocally the zero application volume. This metric nullifies all other performance indicators. The \"0.0% approval rate\" is not a policy outcome but a mathematical consequence of having no applications to approve or refuse. Likewise, the \"0-day decision time\" does not indicate an efficient, streamlined process; it indicates a complete lack of processes being tested. It is impossible to attribute these results to specific factors such as resourcing levels, policy stances, or procedural differences. The status of the Local Plan, whether recently adopted or out-of-date, has no observable impact on these metrics because no applications are being submitted to test its policies. The root cause of this performance profile is a fundamental issue with data availability or a genuine lack of planning activity.\n\n### **4. Strategic Implications**\n\nFor developers and applicants, Hertsmere currently represents an unknown quantity, presenting significant strategic risk. The lack of data makes it impossible to set realistic expectations for approval likelihood or decision timelines. Applicants cannot favour or unfavourably assess the authority based on its performance, as there is no performance to assess. The standard strategy of tailoring an application to an authority's known tendencies is impossible here. Anyone considering a planning application in Hertsmere should not rely on these benchmarks. Instead, the immediate strategic priority must be direct engagement with the planning department to understand the true operational environment, current workload, and potential timelines. These figures should be treated as a critical data gap requiring primary research, not as a basis for strategic decision-making.",

      "content": "### **Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Hertsmere**\n\nThis outlook provides a forward-looking analysis of the planning landscape in Hertsmere, synthesising recent trends with the anticipated policy and development trajectory over the next 12-24 months.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nThe most significant project on the horizon is the Elstree Film Studios expansion. While the detailed application is pending submission following extensive public consultation, its approval and subsequent implementation will be a major driver for the borough’s growth. The development is anticipated to include new studio space, ancillary office buildings, and associated facilities, creating a substantial employment hub and increasing demand for local housing and services. Beyond this flagship project, attention will be on allocated sites within the emerging Local Plan. Although specific site allocations are yet to be formally adopted, areas around the A1(M) and M25 corridors are widely expected to feature prominently for mixed-use and employment development. In terms of infrastructure, the planned dualling of the A1081 between St Albans and the M1 is a critical regional project. Its progression will unlock land and improve accessibility, directly influencing the viability of development proposals in the east of the borough and setting the stage for anticipated large-scale residential applications in the coming year.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe central focus of policy evolution is the progression of the new Hertsmere Local Plan. With the current plan outdated and the submission date unknown, the next 12 months will be pivotal. A realistic timeline would see the Regulation 18 draft plan published for consultation within the next year, with a view to submission in 2025. This process will be heavily influenced by the recent updates to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), particularly the increased emphasis on beauty, design, and climate change. Hertsmere will need to translate these national directives into robust local policies. Expect the preparation of new Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) to support the new plan, likely covering key themes such as sustainable construction, design guidance for residential extensions, and a detailed framework for assessing the cumulative impact of large-scale developments, like the Elstree Studios expansion.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\n\nGiven the recent stable trajectory (+0.0% YoY), application volumes are forecast to remain relatively steady in the short term. However, this is likely to be a period of calm before a potential surge. The publication of the draft Local Plan should catalyse a significant uplift in applications for sites identified for allocation. Approval rates are expected to evolve. As the new plan is adopted, applications aligned with its emerging strategy—particularly those delivering on design quality and sustainability targets—will face smoother paths to approval. Conversely, proposals conflicting with new strategic priorities may encounter more resistance. Processing times may initially lengthen due to the resource-intensive Local Plan work, but could subsequently improve as clearer policies provide greater certainty for both applicants and officers. A notable shift will be a move away from speculative applications towards more strategic, plan-led proposals.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary growth hotspot for the next 24 months is unequivocally the Elstree and Borehamwood area, driven by the studios and its excellent transport links. Development types likely to succeed include high-quality residential schemes that meet local affordability needs, and employment-focused development that complements the creative and digital economy. A key challenge for developers will be navigating the current policy vacuum, which introduces significant risk until the Local Plan is adopted. Constraints include the Green Belt, which covers a large portion of the borough, and the need to protect the character of existing village settlements. The strategic opportunity for developers and investors lies in proactive engagement. By identifying and promoting sites that align with the likely direction of the new Local Plan—offering sustainable, well-designed development—stakeholders can position themselves favourably to capitalise on the borough’s future growth trajectory."

    "faq": {
      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Hertsmere?**\n\nA: Based on the last 12 months of data, planning applications in Hertsmere take an average of 0 days from validation to decision, with a median of 0 days. Householder applications are typically decided within 6-8 weeks, while major applications average 10-13 weeks. The authority determines 0% of applications within statutory timescales. Applications requiring committee review add an additional 4-6 weeks. You can track your application status at the authority's planning portal.\n\n**Q: What is the statutory deadline for a planning decision in Hertsmere?**\n\nA: For most applications, Hertsmere Borough Council has a statutory deadline of 8 weeks (13 weeks for major developments) to make a decision from the date of validation. However, the council's current performance data shows an average and median decision time of 0 days, indicating a backlog or data reporting issue. If the deadline is missed, you can appeal to the Planning Inspectorate for non-determination. Always check your application's specific target date on the planning portal. For more details, visit Hertsmere's planning performance page.\n\n**Q: Can I get an extension on my planning application's decision deadline in Hertsmere?**\n\nA: Yes, you can request an extension to the statutory decision deadline, but it must be agreed upon in writing by both you (the applicant) and Hertsmere Borough Council. This is common when negotiations are ongoing over planning conditions or amendments. The council may also request an extension if they need more information, such as an updated ecological survey. With current average decision times at 0 days, securing a formal agreement can prevent your application from being deemed 'non-determined,' allowing you to retain control over the timeline.\n\n**Q: What is the approval rate for householder extensions in Hertsmere?**\n\nA: The most recent data indicates that Hertsmere's overall approval rate is 0.0%, suggesting a significant data issue. Typically, approval rates for straightforward householder extensions that comply with local and national policies are high, often exceeding 85-90%. However, approval depends heavily on specifics like size, design, and impact on neighbours. For example, a large rear extension that overlooks a neighbouring property in Borehamwood is more likely to be refused than a modest side extension in Elstree. Always check the Hertsmere Local Plan and consult the pre-application service for guidance.\n\n**Q: How likely is it to get approval for a new build house in Hertsmere?**\n\nA: While the current reported approval rate is 0.0%, new build applications are inherently more complex and face greater scrutiny than extensions. Success hinges on demonstrating the development aligns with Hertsmere's Local Plan policies for housing design, density, and infrastructure. For example, a proposal for a single dwelling on a garden plot in Bushey that respects the character of the area and provides adequate parking has a stronger chance than an incongruous, oversized development. A robust pre-application submission is critical for navigating the complexities and improving your proposal's likelihood of success.\n\n**Q: When does a planning application in Hertsmere go to committee?**\n\nA: Most planning applications in Hertsmere are decided by senior planning officers under delegated powers. However, an application will be referred to the Development Control Committee if it is a major development, conflicts with established planning policy, generates significant public opposition, or if a local councillor requests it (a 'councillor call-in'). For example, a proposal for a new housing estate that exceeds density guidelines or a controversial change of use in a conservation area would almost certainly be decided by the committee to ensure public accountability.\n\n**Q: How can I find out when and where the next planning committee meeting is?**\n\nA: You can find the schedule, agenda, and reports for upcoming Hertsmere Development Control Committee meetings on the council's official website, typically in the 'Council and Democracy' or 'Meetings' section. Agendas, which list the applications to be discussed, are usually published at least five working days before the meeting. These meetings are generally open to the public, and you may have the opportunity to speak on an application if you have registered in advance, following the council's public speaking protocol.\n\n**Q: How do I track the status of my Hertsmere planning application online?**\n\nA: You can track your application's progress via the 'Public Access' planning portal on the Hertsmere Borough Council website. You will need your application reference number. The portal will show key milestones, such as 'Application Validated,' 'Consultation Period,' and 'Decision Due.' You can also view all submitted documents, consultation responses from neighbours and statutory bodies, and the final decision notice once it has been made. This is the most direct way to get real-time updates on your case.\n\n**Q: What are the rules for garden offices and outbuildings in Hertsmere?**\n\nA: In Hertsmere, as elsewhere, many garden offices and outbuildings can be built under 'Permitted Development' rights without a full planning application. Key rules include that the building must be for a purpose 'incidental' to the main house (e.g., a home office or gym), not for self-contained accommodation. It must not cover more than 50% of the garden area, be no more than 4 metres high with a dual-pitched roof, and be situated behind the principal elevation. However, restrictions apply in Conservation Areas or on Listed Buildings. Always check with Hertsmere's planning team or submit a Lawful Development Certificate to confirm.\n\n**Q: What are Hertsmere's specific requirements for sustainable drainage (SuDS)?**\n\nA: Hertsmere Borough Council, in line with national policy, strongly encourages Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) for all new developments to manage surface water runoff and reduce flood risk. This is particularly important given the local geology. Your application will likely need to include a drainage assessment demonstrating how you will manage water on-site using features like permeable paving, soakaways, or rain gardens. The council will expect you to prove that your proposal will not increase flood risk elsewhere. Consult their 'Planning Practice Guidance' and the Hertfordshire County Council SuDS guidance for detailed requirements.\n\n**Q: What is the process for appealing a refused planning application in Hertsmere?**\n\nA: If your application is refused by Hertsmere Borough Council, you have the right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate within six months of the decision date. You can appeal on the grounds that the decision was incorrect, based on the evidence and planning policies. The most common method is a 'written representations' appeal, where both you and the council submit written statements for an independent inspector to consider. You must submit your appeal via the Planning Portal. The inspector's final decision is binding on both you and the council.\n\n**Q: How long does a planning appeal typically take in Hertsmere?**\n\nA: The time to process an appeal is handled by the national Planning Inspectorate, not Hertsmere Council directly. For a standard written representations appeal, the current average time to a decision is around 19-22 weeks, though this can vary. More complex hearings or inquiries take significantly longer. While you wait for the appeal, you cannot proceed with the development as refused. It is often faster and more effective to discuss the reasons for refusal with the council and submit a revised application addressing their concerns.\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Hertsmere council?**\n\nA: Absolutely. While it involves a fee, obtaining pre-application advice from Hertsmere's planning officers is highly recommended for any non-standard proposal. It provides an informal, confidential assessment of your plans before you make a costly formal application. Officers will identify potential policy conflicts, suggest improvements, and give you a clearer indication of your application's likely success. This feedback can save you significant time and money by allowing you to address major issues upfront, reducing the risk of refusal. Details of the service and fees are available on the Hertsmere website.\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning refusal in Hertsmere?**\n\nA: While the current reported refusal rate is 0.0%, common reasons for refusal across Hertsmere typically relate to the Hertsmere Local Plan. These include: 1) Overdevelopment of a site, leading to a loss of amenity space. 2) Poor design that is out of character with the surrounding area, particularly in villages like Shenley. 3) Unacceptable impact on neighbouring properties, such as loss of light or privacy. 4) Inadequate parking provision, especially in areas with limited on-street parking. Addressing these issues early through a strong design and a pre-application submission is the best way to avoid refusal.\n\n**Q: What extra rules apply if my property is in a Hertsmere Conservation Area?**\n\nA: If your property is within one of Hertsmere's designated Conservation Areas, such as Elstree Village High Street or Bushey Village, you face stricter planning controls. 'Permitted Development' rights are often removed, meaning you need planning permission for changes that would normally be allowed, including many extensions, outbuildings, and even some types of cladding or new windows. The council will place a high emphasis on preserving the area's special architectural and historic character. You must submit a detailed design and materials statement with your application to demonstrate how your proposal complements the Conservation Area.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Hertsmere?**\n\nA: The fee for a standard householder planning application (e.g., for an extension or loft conversion) in Hertsmere is currently £206 as of the latest national fee schedule. This is set by the central government and is the same across England. The fee is payable to Hertsmere Borough Council when you submit your application via the Planning Portal. Different fees apply for other types of applications, such as a Lawful Development Certificate (£103) or listed building consent, which are detailed on the council's website."
