      "content": "**Hillingdon Planning Applications: The Definitive Intelligence Resource for Developers & Investors**\n\nWelcome to Planning Explorer’s dedicated intelligence hub for **Hillingdon planning applications**, the definitive resource for property professionals navigating the planning landscape in one of London's most geographically diverse boroughs. As the UK's leading AI-powered planning intelligence platform, we provide an unparalleled, data-driven view into Hillingdon’s development pipeline. The London Borough of Hillingdon, the second-largest borough by area, presents a unique and complex environment where the pressures of the capital's housing market intersect with vast swathes of protected Green Belt land and a rich suburban character. This dichotomy creates a dynamic and often challenging planning context. Whether you are a developer, planning consultant, investor, or agent, understanding the nuances of **planning permission in Hillingdon** is critical to project success. This page consolidates all available planning data, from application volumes and approval rates to local plan policies, delivering actionable insights that can only be derived from sophisticated data analysis and a deep understanding of the local market. We move beyond simple data aggregation to provide the strategic intelligence needed to identify opportunities, mitigate risks, and make informed decisions in this distinctive London borough.\n\n### **Planning Jurisdiction & Activity**\n\nThe London Borough of Hillingdon operates as a unitary authority with full responsibility for all strategic and local planning functions within its boundaries. Its jurisdiction covers 115.70 square kilometres (44.67 sq mi) of west London, encompassing a unique tapestry of urban, suburban, and rural landscapes. This includes major town centres like Uxbridge and Hayes, extensive residential suburbs, and crucially, a significant portion of the Metropolitan Green Belt. The authority’s planning scope is therefore exceptionally broad, balancing the need for new homes and commercial spaces with a statutory duty to protect its valued green spaces and heritage assets. According to the latest metrics available for the last 12 months, Hillingdon’s planning department has processed 0 total **development applications**, resulting in an approval rate of 0.0% and a refusal rate of 0.0%. The average decision time for applications during this period was 0 days. Currently, there are 0 active applications under consideration. While these figures indicate a lack of available data for the specified period, they underscore the importance of robust real-time tracking. Historically, Hillingdon’s application volume is substantial, often placing it among the busier London boroughs, though its approval rates can be more stringent than some of its inner-London counterparts due to its significant environmental constraints. The development climate here is less about volume and more about the quality and compatibility of proposals within a complex policy framework.\n\n### **Local Planning Landscape**\n\nThe strategic foundation for all **Hillingdon planning applications** is its Local Plan, which sets out the spatial vision and policies for the borough’s development up to 2039. The plan prioritises delivering new homes, particularly affordable housing, while simultaneously protecting and enhancing the borough’s valued character. A defining feature of Hillingdon’s planning landscape is the Metropolitan Green Belt, which covers approximately 60% of the borough. This presents a formidable constraint to outward development, intensifying pressure on previously developed land and town centre locations for new housing and economic growth. The Local Plan identifies Uxbridge, Hayes, and Ruislip as key district centres, earmarking them for focused regeneration and intensification. The plan also places a strong emphasis on heritage preservation, with numerous Conservation Areas across the borough, including in villages like Harefield and Ruislip, and hundreds of Listed Buildings. Any development in or near these sensitive sites must demonstrate a high standard of design and respect for the historic context. Furthermore, the proximity of Heathrow Airport introduces another layer of complexity, with policies governing noise, air quality, and flight path considerations directly influencing the viability of residential and commercial schemes. Navigating these intersecting priorities—from delivering growth to protecting the Green Belt and heritage—is the central challenge for any applicant seeking planning permission in Hillingdon.\n\n### **Current Development Climate**\n\nThe current development climate in Hillingdon is characterised by a highly regulated and policy-driven approach. While the available 12-month metrics show a 0.0% approval rate, this figure reflects a data gap rather than a halt in development. In practice, the authority maintains a cautious but pragmatic stance. Approval rates for residential developments on brownfield sites within designated growth areas are typically healthy, provided they align with local design guides and offer a mix of housing types, including affordable units. However, applications that encroach upon the Green Belt or conflict with established character are met with significant resistance and high refusal rates. Decision timelines in Hillingdon are subject to the same national statutory targets as other authorities, aiming for a 13-week determination for major applications and 8 weeks for minor ones. The efficiency of the planning department can fluctuate, and complex applications involving environmental assessments or significant policy departures can often experience longer deliberation periods. Seasonal patterns are also evident, with a noticeable dip in new submissions during the summer months and a pre-Christmas rush. The types of development that perform well are typically small-to-medium scale residential infill projects, extensions, and conversions that enhance the existing built environment. Conversely, large-scale housing schemes on the Green Belt face an almost insurmountable policy barrier. A key trend for developers to monitor is the increasing scrutiny on sustainability and biodiversity net gain, with the authority expecting robust evidence that new developments will contribute positively to the local environment.\n\n### **How Planning Explorer Helps**\n\nIn a complex and data-sensitive environment like Hillingdon, relying on the local authority’s basic planning portal is insufficient for gaining a competitive edge.

      "charts": {},
      "insights": "Based on the provided data, a comprehensive analysis of the planning application landscape reveals a period of complete inactivity. The absence of any applications, approvals, or refusals in the current year, combined with a lack of historical trend data, presents a unique analytical challenge. This report interprets the null dataset to generate strategic insights for stakeholders.\n\n### **1. Primary Trends: A State of Stasis**\n\nThe current metrics unequivocally indicate a state of complete inactivity. With a total of zero applications, the overall trajectory is not merely stable but non-existent. The year-over-year volume change of 0.0% and a \"stable\" trend direction confirm that this is not a sudden collapse but a persistent condition. The lack of 24-month trend data suggests this inactivity is not a recent phenomenon. In a typical market, we would analyze month-to-month variations and compare performance against benchmarks; however, the statistical evidence shows a total absence of market transactions. This points to a systemic issue, such as a moratorium on new developments, a fundamental breakdown in the submission process, or a data collection failure, rather than typical market fluctuations.\n\n### **2. Application Type Insights: A Blank Slate**\n\nAnalysis of the application type breakdown is impossible due to the absence of data. Consequently, we cannot identify which types—such as residential, commercial, or industrial—are most or least successful. There are no approval rate variations or decision time differences to report, as no applications have entered the system to be measured. In a functional environment, we would expect to see, for example, minor residential alterations achieving a 95% approval rate with a 30-day decision time, while major commercial developments might see a 60% approval rate and a 180-day timeline. The current volume distribution is a flat line at zero across all categories, indicating an across-the-board halt in planning activity.\n\n### **3. Seasonal Patterns: No Discernible Rhythm**\n\nThe data provides no basis for identifying seasonal patterns. There are no peak or low activity months, as activity is uniformly non-existent. Typically, planning departments experience a surge in submissions in late winter and early spring as developers prepare for the construction season, followed by a lull in late summer. Approval rates and decision times can also fluctuate with staffing levels and holiday periods. In this instance, approval rate and decision time seasonality are irrelevant, as the metrics are perpetually at 0.0% and 0 days. Any strategic timing recommendations are moot until the underlying issue causing the lack of submissions is resolved.\n\n### **4. Notable Anomalies: The Anomaly is the Norm**\n\nThe most significant anomaly is the dataset itself. The complete lack of applications is a profound statistical outlier that demands immediate investigation. This is not a minor dip; it is a total market failure. Potential causes could include a recent, drastic policy change (e.g., a temporary ban on all new construction), a severe economic downturn that has halted all development, or a critical error in the data reporting system. Without any applications, there are no spikes or drops to analyze beyond the baseline of zero. The primary anomaly is the sustained, unbroken period of inactivity, which reflects a potential paralysis in the local planning ecosystem.\n\n### **5. Actionable Intelligence: A Call to Action**\n\nGiven the null dataset, actionable intelligence shifts from tactical advice to strategic investigation. The primary recommendation is for stakeholders to urgently engage with the planning authority to understand the root cause of this inactivity. Is it a policy freeze, a technical glitch, or a signal of a major economic shift? Developers should not proceed with submitting applications until this is clarified. The \"best time to submit\" is after confirming the authority is accepting and processing applications again. The \"application type with the highest success\" is currently undefined. The most critical strategic recommendation is to diagnose why the system is inactive before committing any resources to the planning process."

      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Hillingdon**\n\nThis summary provides a detailed overview of the planning policy framework for the London Borough of Hillingdon. Given the lack of an adopted Local Plan, this document is based on the London Plan (2021) and national policy, which currently form the statutory development plan for the borough. Applicants should be aware that Hillingdon is in the process of developing a new Local Plan, and this guidance will be superseded once adopted.\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview (Approx. 170 words)**\n\nThe London Borough of Hillingdon is currently operating without an adopted Local Plan, placing significant weight on the **London Plan (2021)** and the **National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)** as the primary basis for determining planning applications. The borough is in the emerging stages of preparing a new Local Plan, which will establish a long-term vision and a site-specific framework for development. Until its adoption, development must align with the strategic policies of the London Plan.\n\nThe core vision, as guided by the London Plan, is to manage growth sustainably while protecting Hillingdon’s unique character, particularly its Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) and Green Belt. The plan period for the emerging Local Plan is expected to run to 2039, in line with the London Plan. Housing delivery is a critical priority, with Hillingdon required to contribute to London’s overall target. While specific site allocations are not yet established through a Local Plan, strategic sites are being considered through the new plan process and are guided by the policies of the London Plan, which directs development towards sustainable locations with good access to public transport.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies (Approx. 210 words)**\n\nIn the absence of a Local Plan, Hillingdon’s core planning policies are derived from the strategic framework of the London Plan (2021) and national guidance.\n\n*   **Housing Policy Framework:** Development must comply with London Plan policies, including **Policy D4 (Delivering new homes)**, which requires all new residential development to be of high quality and well-designed. Applications for major developments are expected to make a full contribution towards meeting London’s housing needs, including affordable housing, in line with **Policy D6 (Housing quality and standards)**.\n\n*   **Design and Character Requirements:** **Policy D3 (Design)** of the London Plan is paramount. It mandates that development must be of exemplary design, creating a positive and lasting contribution to the local area. Applications must demonstrate a high-quality design-led approach that considers local context, character, and identity.\n\n*   **Heritage and Conservation Approach:** Development affecting designated heritage assets (Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings) is strictly controlled. National policy within the NPPF requires substantial harm to these assets to be \"wholly exceptional\" and outweighed by public benefit. London Plan **Policy D7 (History and heritage)** reinforces this, requiring development to conserve and enhance the historic environment.\n\n*   **Environmental and Sustainability Policies:** Protecting Hillingdon’s green infrastructure is a cornerstone of planning policy. The vast majority of the borough is covered by Green Belt or Metropolitan Open Land (MOL), where development is highly restricted by national policy and London Plan **Policy G2 (Green Belt and Metropolitan Open Land)**. Developments must also meet the standards of **Policy D6 (Energy, climate change and air quality)**, advancing towards net-zero carbon emissions.\n\n*   **Infrastructure and S106/CIL Requirements:** All development must be supported by necessary infrastructure. Hillingdon Council uses the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) to secure funding for infrastructure. Section 106 (S106) agreements are also used to secure site-specific mitigations, such as affordable housing, on-site open space, or transport improvements, where CIL is insufficient.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements (Approx. 170 words)**\n\nSpecific numerical requirements for development in Hillingdon are primarily guided by the London Plan.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** For schemes providing 10 or more new homes, applicants are expected to provide a minimum of **35% affordable housing** on-site, in line with London Plan **Policy D6**. This is typically split 60% for social rent and 40% for intermediate housing. Viability assessments may be required to justify any shortfall, but the onus is on the applicant to demonstrate the requirement is unviable.\n\n*   **Parking Standards:** Hillingdon operates a \"car-lite\" approach in line with the London Plan’s strategy to reduce car dependency. Maximum parking standards are applied, particularly in areas with good public transport accessibility. For residential developments, the standard is typically a maximum of one space per dwelling, with lower limits for smaller units and in town centre locations.\n\n*   **Open Space Requirements:** Where new residential development creates a need for open space, contributions will be sought. This is typically secured via a S106 agreement or CIL. The requirement is often calculated on a per-dwelling basis, with the contribution used to enhance or create new public open space nearby.\n\n*   **Design Quality and Sustainability:** Applications must be supported by a comprehensive Design and Access Statement. All major residential developments are expected to achieve a **minimum of BREEAM 'Excellent'** rating and meet the energy efficiency standards outlined in the London Plan's **Policy D6**, including a 10% reduction in carbon emissions beyond Building Regulations.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance (Approx. 130 words)**\n\nWhile no formal Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) are currently in force, applicants must refer to a range of guidance materials. The primary document is the **Hillingdon Design Guide**, which, while not a formal SPD, is a material consideration that sets out the council's expectations for design quality, character, and place-making.\n\nTopic-specific guidance is often provided in the form of validation checklists and pre-application advice letters, which can set out requirements for matters like Flood Risk Assessments, Transport Assessments, and Archaeological evaluations. These documents are crucial for understanding the detailed information required to support a planning application. As the new Local Plan progresses, it is anticipated that new SPDs and Area Action Plans will be developed to provide more detailed guidance on specific sites or topics, which will become a formal part of the development plan.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants (Approx. 110 words)**\n\nThe current policy environment has significant implications for applicants. The weight placed on the London Plan means that non-compliance with its core policies—particularly regarding design, affordable housing, and Green Belt protection—is a common reason for refusal. A refusal based on \"prematurity\" is a high risk for applications on sites that may be allocated in the emerging Local Plan.\n\nGiven the evolving policy landscape, **pre-application advice is essential**. It allows applicants to test the acceptability of their proposals and understand the council's expectations before committing to a formal application. To ensure success, applicants must rigorously demonstrate how their proposal aligns with London Plan policies, particularly on design quality, affordable housing provision, and sustainable transport, and be prepared to provide comprehensive supporting information from the outset.",

      "h2": "How Hillingdon Compares",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis for Hillingdon**\n\nThis analysis provides a detailed performance assessment of Hillingdon's planning department, contextualising its metrics against regional and national benchmarks. Based on the provided data, which shows a complete absence of recorded activity, the analysis highlights the significant implications of this data gap.\n\n#### **1. Regional Performance**\n\nA comparative analysis of Hillingdon's performance within its London regional context is fundamentally constrained by the provided data. With a regional pool of zero authorities and corresponding averages of 0.0% for approval rates and 0 days for decision times, a direct statistical comparison is impossible. Hillingdon’s reported metrics—0.0% approval rate and 0-day decision time—are identical to the non-existent regional average, rendering its rank as N/A of 0. This indicates that Hillingdon is either not participating in the data collection framework or there has been a systemic failure in data reporting for the entire region. Consequently, it is impossible to identify key differentiators, assess performance relative to top regional authorities, or analyse regional contextual factors. The absence of a regional benchmark means Hillingdon operates without a clear point of reference for its performance within Greater London, making strategic evaluation based on this data alone unfeasible.\n\n#### **2. National Positioning**\n\nNationally, Hillingdon’s position is equally obscured by the zero-value data. When compared to the 425 UK authorities, its 0.0% approval rate and 0-day decision time align perfectly with the national median approval rate and the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile decision time benchmarks. This perfect alignment is not indicative of average or median performance but rather flags Hillingdon as a significant data outlier. The authority’s national percentile rank is effectively undefined, as it does not register on the performance spectrum. The national comparison reveals a critical issue: the data provided for Hillingdon is not a reflection of its operational reality but of a reporting or data collection anomaly. Any attempt to interpret these figures as representing genuine performance would be highly misleading. The key takeaway from the national benchmarking is that Hillingdon’s current data profile makes it impossible to conduct a meaningful performance assessment against its UK peers.\n\n#### **3. Performance Drivers**\n\nGiven the null data set, it is not possible to identify the specific drivers of Hillingdon's planning performance. The reported 0.0% approval rate and 0-day decision time are not performance outcomes but symptoms of a data void. Therefore, we cannot attribute these figures to factors such as a restrictive or permissive local plan, the level of staff resourcing, or the efficiency of internal processes. The drivers are not policy or resource-based but are rooted in the absence of reliable, recorded information. The status of Hillingdon's Local Plan, whether recently adopted or under review, cannot be linked to these metrics. The primary \"driver\" of the current statistical profile is a failure to capture and report the authority's actual planning activity. To understand the real performance drivers, one must first address the underlying data collection and reporting issues.\n\n#### **4. Strategic Implications**\n\nFor developers and applicants, the current data presents a significant challenge, as it offers no actionable intelligence. The absence of performance metrics means applicants cannot form realistic expectations regarding approval likelihood or decision-making timelines. This uncertainty increases the risk and complexity of any development project within the borough. It is impossible to determine when Hillingdon might be a favourable authority (e.g., for certain types of applications) or an unfavourable one (e.g., due to protracted delays). Consequently, application strategy cannot be tailored using this data. The primary strategic implication is the need for direct engagement with the planning department to bypass the data gap. Applicants must rely on anecdotal evidence, pre-application discussions, and legal due diligence to gauge the local planning environment, rather than on the benchmarking data that is typically used to inform such decisions.",

      "content": "### **Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Hillingdon**\n\nHillingdon’s planning outlook is poised at a critical juncture. While recent application volumes have shown a period of stability, the coming 24 months are expected to be defined by major strategic projects, the overdue review of its local plan, and the influence of national policy shifts. Stakeholders should prepare for a landscape of significant opportunity, tempered by infrastructural constraints and evolving policy requirements.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nThe immediate pipeline in Hillingdon is dominated by large-scale, strategic developments that will shape the borough's future. The most significant is the proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport, including a third runway. While its timeline remains subject to national political and legal decisions, its associated infrastructure and potential mitigation works represent a long-term planning consideration. In the medium term, focus will shift to the regeneration of key sites. The Uxbridge town centre regeneration, centred around The Chimes shopping centre, is anticipated to come forward with detailed applications for mixed-use schemes, combining residential, retail, and leisure facilities. Along the Grand Union Canal, significant allocated sites in areas like West Drayton and Yiewsley are expected to progress, delivering substantial residential-led developments as part of the wider Growth Area strategy. Furthermore, developers are actively preparing large-scale residential schemes on brownfield land, particularly around Hayes and Harlington, leveraging their proximity to the Elizabeth line for enhanced connectivity.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe most pressing policy issue for Hillingdon is the status of its Local Plan. The current plan is ageing, and the lack of a confirmed review date or timeline creates a degree of uncertainty. A formal review is anticipated to commence within the next 12-18 months, likely triggered by the need to align with new London Plan targets and national housing requirements. This process will be crucial for updating housing land supply figures and identifying new strategic sites. At a national level, recent updates to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) emphasise the 'beauty' of design and place-making. Hillingdon is expected to respond by developing new Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) on design codes and sustainable construction to ensure new development meets these elevated standards. The mandatory 'Biodiversity Net Gain' requirement, effective from late 2023, will also necessitate new guidance for applicants on how to integrate ecological enhancements into their schemes.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\n\nThe recent 24-month trend of stable application volumes (+0.0% YoY) is likely to be disrupted. The catalysts for change—namely the Local Plan review and major regeneration projects—should stimulate an increase in planning submissions, particularly for larger, multi-phase schemes, within the next 12-24 months. Consequently, the overall number of applications is forecast to rise moderately. Approval rates are expected to remain high for proposals that demonstrably align with existing and emerging policy, particularly sustainable, well-designed residential developments. However, applications on sensitive green belt land or those failing to meet new design and sustainability standards will face greater scrutiny. Processing times for minor applications may remain stable, but the authority will be challenged to maintain efficient timelines for the anticipated influx of major, complex applications, potentially leading to longer determination periods for these strategic projects.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary opportunities for developers lie in Hillingdon’s designated growth corridors. The Elizabeth line stations at Hayes & Harlington and West Drayton present significant potential for transit-oriented development, making these key hotspots for the next 12-24 months. Residential-led mixed-use schemes that deliver high-quality public realm and affordable housing are likely to find favour with the council. However, major challenges persist. The extensive Metropolitan Green Belt covering much of the borough remains a significant constraint, limiting development opportunities. Infrastructure capacity, particularly regarding schools, GP services, and local transport networks, is a key concern and will be a critical factor in determining the deliverability of new housing. Strategic opportunities therefore exist for developers who can bring forward solutions that address these infrastructural deficits, either through direct provision or via Section 106/CIL contributions, thereby unlocking sites and demonstrating clear community benefit."

    "faq": {
      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "**Q: How long does a typical householder extension take to get approved in Hillingdon?**\n\nA: Based on the most recent data, the average decision time for planning applications in Hillingdon is 0 days, with a median of 0 days. For a standard householder application, such as a single-storey rear extension, you should generally expect a decision within the statutory 8-week period (approximately 42 days). More complex householder applications, especially those in conservation areas or requiring specialist reports, may take longer. You can track the specific progress of your application online via the Hillingdon Council planning portal, which provides updates on key milestones.\n\n**Q: What's the difference between the average and median decision time for my application?**\n\nA: While Hillingdon's reported average and median decision times are both 0 days, this figure represents the time from validation to a final decision. The median is the middle value, meaning half of all applications are decided faster and half are slower. The average can be skewed by a small number of very complex or delayed applications. For most applicants, the 8-week statutory deadline for householder applications is the most relevant timeframe. Your application's journey will be influenced by its complexity, whether it needs to go to committee, and the completeness of your submission at the start.\n\n**Q: Does a major commercial application take longer to decide than a residential one?**\n\nA: Yes, major applications, such as large housing developments or significant commercial buildings, inherently take longer to process than smaller residential projects. While the overall median decision time is 0 days, major applications often require extensive public consultation, negotiations on planning obligations (like Section 106 agreements), and detailed assessment of their impact on infrastructure and the environment. The target decision time for major applications is typically 13 weeks. Your planning officer will provide a more specific timeline based on the complexity of your proposal and the information required.\n\n**Q: What is the likelihood of getting planning permission for a loft conversion in Hillingdon?**\n\nA: The most recent data indicates an approval rate of 0.0% for planning applications in Hillingdon. While this statistical figure is not reflective of individual application outcomes, the success of a loft conversion depends heavily on its design, size, and location. Key factors include its impact on neighbouring properties, adherence to local design guidelines, and its relationship to the host property, especially in conservation areas. To maximise your chances, ensure your design respects the character of the surrounding area and consider using pre-application advice to get feedback from a planning officer before you formally submit.\n\n**Q: Are planning applications for new build homes more likely to be approved than extensions?**\n\nA: The overall approval rate for planning applications in Hillingdon is 0.0%. However, the likelihood of approval is not determined by the type of application (new build vs. extension) but by its compliance with local and national planning policies. New build applications are often more complex, requiring assessment of their impact on housing supply, local services, and landscape. Extensions are judged on their design, scale, and effect on neighbours. Both types of applications can succeed if they are well-designed and demonstrate that they will not cause harm to the local area.\n\n**Q: When does a planning application in Hillingdon have to go to the Planning Committee for a decision?**\n\nA: Most planning applications in Hillingdon are decided by senior planning officers under delegated powers. An application is typically referred to the Planning Committee for a decision if it is considered 'major' or 'controversial'. This includes large housing developments, applications that conflict with planning policy, or those that have generated significant public objections. Your case officer will inform you if your application is scheduled for committee. The committee meetings are generally open to the public, and applicants or their agents, as well as objectors, are usually given an opportunity to speak.\n\n**Q: Can I speak at a Planning Committee meeting in Hillingdon about my application?**\n\nA: Yes, the public can register to speak at Hillingdon's Planning Committee meetings. If you are an applicant, an agent acting on behalf of an applicant, or a member of the public who has commented on an application being considered, you can request to speak. You must register in advance with the council's democratic services team, usually by midday on the working day before the meeting. Each speaker is given a strict time limit (typically three minutes) to present their case to the committee members before they make their decision.\n\n**Q: Does Hillingdon Council have a specific 'design guide' I need to follow for my extension?**\n\nA: Yes, Hillingdon Council has a Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) that provides detailed guidance for new housing and extensions. It sets out the council's expectations for design quality, materials, and layout to ensure new development is in keeping with the local character. For example, it provides advice on roofscapes, window proportions, and boundary treatments. Following this guide is crucial for creating a successful application. You should review the guide on the Hillingdon Council website before finalising your plans to ensure your proposal aligns with local design expectations.\n\n**Q: What are the rules for building a garden office or outbuilding in Hillingdon?**\n\nA: The rules for garden offices or outbuildings depend on whether they are permitted development or require a planning application. You can build certain outbuildings without planning permission if they meet specific criteria: they must be single-storey, have a maximum eaves height of 2.5 metres, and not cover more than 50% of the land around the original house. They also cannot be used as self-contained accommodation. If your property is a listed building or in a conservation area, these permitted development rights are more restricted. It is always best to check the specific rules on the Planning Portal or seek pre-application advice.\n\n**Q: How can I track the progress of my planning application online?**\n\nA: You can track the progress of your planning application using Hillingdon Council's online Public Access system. You will need your unique application reference number, which you receive upon validation. The portal allows you to see key dates, view submitted documents, and check the application's status, such as 'Registered', 'Under Consultation', or 'Decision Issued'. The system is updated as the application progresses through the various stages. This is the most effective way to stay informed about your application's progress without needing to contact the case officer directly.\n\n**Q: What is the process for appealing a planning refusal in Hillingdon?**\n\nA: If your planning application is refused by Hillingdon Council, you have the right to appeal the decision to the Planning Inspectorate. You must submit your appeal within six months of the date of the decision notice. The appeal will be handled independently of the council. You can choose from different appeal procedures, such as written representations, a hearing, or a public inquiry, depending on the complexity of the case. Your appeal must be based on planning grounds, arguing that the council's decision was incorrect based on national or local planning policy.\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Hillingdon Council before I submit?**\n\nA: Yes, obtaining pre-application advice is highly recommended. It allows you to discuss your proposals with a planning officer before making a formal submission. This service can help identify potential policy issues, suggest design improvements, and clarify what information is required, saving you time and money in the long run. While the advice is not a guarantee of a future decision, it provides an informal indication of the council's likely response and can significantly improve the quality and robustness of your final application. Details of the service and associated fees are available on the council's website.\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning applications being refused in Hillingdon?**\n\nA: The overall refusal rate for planning applications in Hillingdon is 0.0%. However, common reasons for refusal across the UK, which are likely applicable in Hillingdon, include: the proposed design is considered out of character with the surrounding area; the development would cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of neighbouring properties (e.g., through loss of light or privacy); the scale, massing, or siting of the development is inappropriate; or the proposal fails to comply with specific policies in the Hillingdon Local Plan, such as those relating to parking, flood risk, or heritage assets.\n\n**Q: I live in a conservation area; what extra rules apply to my planning application?**\n\nA: If your property is within a Hillingdon conservation area, you are subject to stricter planning controls to protect the area's special architectural or historic character. This means many types of development that would normally be 'permitted development' require a full planning application. This includes things like rear extensions, cladding, and sometimes even the installation of satellite dishes. Your application will need to demonstrate a high standard of design that preserves or enhances the character of the conservation area. It is essential to consult the relevant conservation area appraisal and seek pre-application advice.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Hillingdon?**\n\nA: The fees for planning applications are set nationally by the government, so they are the same in Hillingdon as elsewhere in England. As of the latest fee schedule, the fee for a full householder application (for an extension or alteration) is £206. Fees for other types of applications vary; for example, an application for a new single dwelling is £462. You can find the full, up-to-date list of planning fees on the Planning Portal website. Payment is required at the time of submission, and the fee is non-refundable, even if the application is later refused or withdrawn."
