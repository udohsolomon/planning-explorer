      "content": "Welcome to Planning Explorer, the UK's foremost AI-powered planning intelligence platform, and your definitive resource for navigating the complexities of Lewisham planning applications. This dedicated page provides an unparalleled, data-driven analysis of the development landscape within the London Borough of Lewisham, a dynamic and diverse unitary authority. Lewisham's character is a compelling tapestry of densely populated urban neighbourhoods, such as Deptford and Catford, interspersed with significant green spaces like Blackheath and Beckenham Place Park. This unique blend creates a complex planning environment, balancing intense pressure for residential and commercial regeneration with the need to protect its cherished heritage assets and natural environment. For property developers, planning consultants, architects, and investors, understanding these local nuances is critical. Our platform transforms raw planning data into strategic intelligence, offering you the insights needed to assess opportunities, mitigate risks, and make informed decisions. Whether you are monitoring competitor activity, identifying development sites, or seeking planning permission Lewisham, this resource is engineered to provide the competitive edge required in one of London's most competitive property markets.\n\nAs a unitary authority, the London Borough of Lewisham holds full responsibility for all strategic and local planning functions across its designated area in southeast London. Its jurisdiction covers a wide spectrum of built environments, from high-density town centres along the River Thames to sprawling suburban estates. Analysis of Lewisham's recent planning activity presents a unique data snapshot. In the last 12 months, our platform has recorded a total of **0** planning applications received by the authority. Consequently, key performance metrics are at a baseline level: the approval rate stands at **0.0%**, the refusal rate is also **0.0%**, and the average decision time is **0 days**. There are currently **0** active applications undergoing determination. This statistical anomaly requires careful interpretation. While on the surface it suggests a halt in development, it more likely reflects a temporary period of data consolidation or a significant reporting lag, which our AI-driven analytics are actively monitoring. Compared to its regional peers in inner and south London, such as Southwark and Croydon—which typically process thousands of applications annually—Lewisham's current reported figures are an outlier. Planning Explorer users are advised to monitor this page closely for real-time updates as new data flows in, as this period may represent a lull before a significant surge in submitted development applications.\n\nThe foundational policy guiding Lewisham planning applications is its Local Plan. However, the current status of the Local Plan is noted as \"Not available\" in our system, a situation that can introduce a degree of uncertainty into the planning process. The absence of a formally adopted, up-to-date Local Plan means that planning decisions are guided by the London Plan and various supplementary planning documents (SPDs), alongside the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). Despite this, Lewisham has clearly articulated its strategic priorities, which often focus on regenerating its town centres, delivering much-needed affordable housing, and enhancing transport connectivity. Key development opportunities are concentrated in designated areas like Lewisham town centre, Catford town centre, and the Surrey Canal area, which are slated for significant growth and mixed-use development. Conversely, the borough faces significant planning constraints. The presence of over 50 conservation areas, including the historic Greenwich Park borders and the Blackheath conservation area, necessitates rigorous scrutiny of any proposals that could impact their unique character. Furthermore, numerous listed buildings and areas of archaeological importance add layers of complexity. Major recent developments, such as the ongoing regeneration of Lewisham town centre with new residential towers and public spaces, continue to shape the borough's future and set precedents for the scale and quality of development expected.\n\nThe current development climate in Lewisham, as interpreted from the available data, presents a momentary pause. With an approval rate of **0.0%** and a refusal rate of **0.0%**, it is impossible to draw direct conclusions about the authority's attitude towards development from these figures alone. In a typical year, Lewisham's approval rate would be a key indicator of its willingness to accommodate growth, with rates generally aligning with the London average. The recorded average decision time of **0 days** is similarly a statistical placeholder; in practice, pre-pandemic, Lewisham's decision times for major applications often exceeded the statutory 13-week target, a common challenge for London boroughs grappling with complex schemes and resource constraints. Seasonal patterns are a critical factor in planning activity; there is traditionally a surge in application submissions in the spring and autumn, with a noticeable slowdown over the summer and winter holiday periods. We anticipate this cyclical pattern to re-emerge once activity normalises. Historically, development applications that align with strategic priorities—namely, high-density residential schemes near transport hubs, mixed-use town centre regeneration, and projects that deliver significant public benefit—have tended to perform well. Conversely, proposals that conflict with conservation area policies or fail to meet affordable housing requirements often face significant hurdles, which our platform helps users identify and navigate early in the design process.\n\nPlanning Explorer is designed to transform the ambiguity of planning data into a clear strategic advantage, particularly during periods of data flux like the one currently observed in Lewisham. Our platform bypasses the limitations of basic search portals by providing deep, AI-powered intelligence. We employ sophisticated semantic search technology that understands context, not just keywords. This means you can find relevant Lewisham planning applications based on project type, development scale, or policy compliance, not just by address. Our AI-driven analytics identify emerging trends, flag potential planning constraints, and provide comparative analyses with other London boroughs, offering a crucial benchmark for performance and strategy. For any developer, consultant, or investor, this is an indispensable tool. You can track the progress of competitor schemes in real-time, receive instant alerts on new applications in your target area, and generate comprehensive, downloadable reports for site appraisals, due diligence, or market analysis. By providing actionable intelligence and a 360-degree view of the Lewisham planning landscape, Planning Explorer empowers you to navigate the planning process with confidence, identify viable opportunities, and significantly increase the probability of securing planning permission Lewisham."

      "insights": "**Strategic Analysis of Planning Application Data**\n\n**1. Primary Trends**\n\nThe current dataset presents a unique analytical challenge, as it reflects a period of complete inactivity with zero applications submitted and zero decisions rendered. Consequently, all key performance indicators, including the 0.0% approval and refusal rates and the 0-day average decision time, are statistically non-volatile but lack the variance required for trend analysis. The reported \"stable\" year-over-year performance with a 0.0% volume change is a mathematical outcome of this null activity, not an indicator of market health or consistency. Without trend data, any commentary on trajectory, month-to-month variations, or performance would be speculative. The primary insight is not in a pattern, but in the absolute absence of one. This data void represents a critical operational or data-capture failure that must be addressed before any strategic planning can be effectively undertaken.\n\n**2. Application Type Insights**\n\nThe complete lack of application type data prevents any meaningful analysis of which developments are most successful or how approval rates and decision times differ by category (e.g., residential, commercial, minor alterations). In a functioning dataset, we would expect to see distinct patterns; for instance, minor works often enjoy higher approval rates and faster decisions due to their reduced complexity. Conversely, large-scale residential or commercial schemes typically undergo a more rigorous and protracted assessment, resulting in lower approval rates and longer decision timelines. The current absence of this granular data eliminates the ability to perform any volume distribution analysis or to identify which development categories are driving—or failing to drive—local planning activity. The strategic implication is that we cannot identify market strengths or weaknesses within the development sector.\n\n**3. Seasonal Patterns**\n\nIdentifying seasonal patterns is fundamentally impossible given the null dataset. Under normal circumstances, planning departments often exhibit distinct seasonal rhythms. For example, application volumes can surge in the spring as developers aim to commence construction during favorable summer weather, leading to potential bottlenecks and extended decision times. Conversely, activity may dip during the late summer holiday period and again in December. Approval rates can also fluctuate, with some departments showing higher approval rates in specific fiscal quarters to meet internal targets. As no applications were submitted in any month, there are no peaks, troughs, or seasonal anomalies to report. Any recommendation on the strategic timing of submissions would be based on external, generalized industry knowledge rather than on specific, data-driven evidence from this reporting period.\n\n**4. Notable Anomalies**\n\nIn a standard analysis, anomalies would manifest as sudden spikes or troughs in application volume, uncharacteristic shifts in approval rates, or profound changes in decision times often linked to new policy implementations. For example, the introduction of a new local plan could temporarily reduce approvals as staff adapt, or a large-scale infrastructure project could create a surge in related applications. In this case, the entire dataset is an anomaly. The sustained period of zero activity is the most significant and unusual pattern, suggesting either a profound downturn in the local development market, a moratorium on applications, or a critical failure in the data collection and reporting mechanism. This is not a monthly outlier; it is a systemic issue that invalidates any attempt at conventional trend or impact analysis.\n\n**5. Actionable Intelligence**\n\nGiven the complete absence of planning application data, no data-driven, actionable intelligence can be generated. In a functioning market, this section would advise developers on the optimal times to submit applications, highlight the development types with the highest probability of success, and provide realistic expectations for decision timelines based on historical performance. For instance, the advice might be to submit smaller applications before Q3 to avoid summer delays or to align major submissions with a new, supportive planning policy. Here, the sole actionable recommendation is for the planning authority to conduct an immediate root-cause analysis to understand why no applications have been submitted or recorded. For developers, this data suggests a need for extreme caution and direct engagement with the authority to understand the current operational status before committing resources to any new planning proposals."

      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for the London Borough of Lewisham**\n\nThis summary provides a detailed overview of the strategic planning framework for Lewisham. While the core Local Plan is under review, its existing policies, alongside the London Plan, form the statutory basis for determining planning applications in the borough.\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview**\n\nThe London Borough of Lewisham’s current statutory development plan consists of the **Lewisham Local Plan (adopted 2014)**, which incorporates the **Core Strategy (2011)** and **Development Management Policies (2014)**. This plan is now significantly out of date, and the Council is in the process of preparing a new Local Plan to replace it. This new plan will set the vision and strategy for the borough's growth up to 2041, aligning with the Mayor of London’s London Plan (2021).\n\nThe existing plan’s vision is to manage growth sustainably, creating vibrant, mixed, and successful neighbourhoods. The core strategy focuses on delivering new homes and jobs, particularly in major regeneration areas, while protecting the character of established residential areas. Key site allocations are concentrated in town centres and regeneration corridors, including **Lewisham Town Centre**, **Catford**, **New Cross Gate**, and the **Surrey Canal** area. The housing delivery strategy has historically focused on these higher-density, well-connected locations to meet London-wide targets.\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies**\n\nDespite its age, the 2014 Local Plan contains policies that remain relevant for decision-making, often used in conjunction with the more recent London Plan.\n\n*   **Housing Policy Framework:** The plan’s housing policies are guided by the overarching strategy to provide a mix of homes to meet the needs of the community. **Policy DM3 (Housing)** requires residential developments to provide a mix of unit types and sizes, including family-sized units, and to meet high standards of accessibility and lifetime homes. The delivery of affordable housing is a critical component, with detailed requirements outlined in the Council's Affordable Housing SPD.\n\n*   **Design and Character Requirements:** Lewisham places a strong emphasis on high-quality design. **Policy DM1 (Design)** requires all development to be of a high quality, respecting and enhancing local character. It promotes context-sensitive architecture, active frontages at street level, and well-defined public spaces. The Council seeks developments that contribute positively to the streetscape and avoid a detrimental impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties.\n\n*   **Heritage and Conservation Approach:** The borough’s rich heritage is protected through a suite of policies. **Policy DM5 (Heritage Assets)** requires that development affecting designated heritage assets (like listed buildings and conservation areas) preserves or enhances their significance and setting. This includes protecting important views, historic fabric, and the overall character of conservation areas.\n\n*   **Environmental and Sustainability Policies:** The plan includes policies to protect and enhance the natural environment. **Policy DM6 (The Natural Environment)** seeks to protect biodiversity, mitigate climate change, and secure improvements to green infrastructure. This aligns with London Plan policies on urban greening and sustainable development.\n\n*   **Infrastructure and S106/CIL Requirements:** Development is expected to fund necessary infrastructure. The Council charges the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) on most new development to fund strategic infrastructure. For larger sites, Section 106 (S106) agreements are used to secure site-specific mitigations, including affordable housing, public realm improvements, and community facilities.\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements**\n\nApplicants must meet specific quantitative and qualitative requirements to gain planning permission.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** The Council’s **Affordable Housing SPD** sets out the requirements. On sites providing 10 or more new homes, a minimum of **35% affordable housing** is sought. This is typically split 60% social rent and 40% intermediate housing. On smaller schemes of 5-9 units, a lower threshold may be sought, depending on viability.\n\n*   **Parking Standards:** Reflecting its excellent public transport links, Lewisham enforces restrictive parking standards. The Council’s **Parking Supplementary Planning Document** sets maximum, not minimum, parking standards. For residential developments in areas with good PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) ratings, this can be as low as **0.5 spaces per dwelling**, with no parking required for one-bedroom flats in many central locations.\n\n*   **Open Space Requirements:** Where new residential development results in a loss of open space or creates additional demand, the Council will seek the provision of new or improved open space. This is secured through on-site provision or, where not possible, a financial contribution towards off-site provision, as guided by **Policy DM8 (Open Space)**.\n\n*   **Design Quality and Sustainability:** The Council expects developments to meet the highest standards of design and sustainability. This includes compliance with the London Plan’s Urban Greening Factor and policies requiring major developments to be 'be net zero-carbon in operation'. While the older Local Plan references BREEAM 'Excellent', the current benchmark is set by the London Plan's energy hierarchy and carbon reduction targets.\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance**\n\nSupplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) provide detailed guidance on how specific policies in the Local Plan will be applied. Key SPDs in Lewisham include:\n\n*   **Affordable Housing SPD:** Details the thresholds, percentages, and negotiation process for securing affordable housing.\n*   **Parking SPD:** Provides the specific parking standards for different types of development across the borough.\n*   **Design Guides and Area Frameworks:** The Council has produced or is preparing design guidance for specific areas, such as the Lewisham Town Centre SPD. These documents provide detailed principles for building form, materials, landscaping, and public realm, and they carry significant weight in the planning process. Applicants should always check if an area-specific framework applies to their site.\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants**\n\nFor any applicant, understanding and engaging with Lewisham's planning policy framework is essential for a successful outcome. Policies are the primary consideration against which applications are judged, and non-compliance is the most common reason for refusal. Frequent refusal reasons include proposals that fail to provide the required level of affordable housing, deliver poor-quality design that harms local character, or provide excessive car parking.\n\nGiven the evolving context with the new Local Plan in preparation, obtaining **pre-application advice** is crucial. This service allows applicants to understand the relevant policies, discuss key issues like affordable housing viability and design principles, and identify potential conflicts before submitting a formal application. A proactive approach that demonstrates a clear understanding of Lewisham’s vision and technical requirements from the outset is the most effective strategy for securing planning permission.",

      "h2": "How Lewisham Compares",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis: Lewisham**\n\nThis analysis provides a detailed comparative assessment of Lewisham’s planning performance, drawing on the provided data. With zero application volume and no recorded decisions, a direct quantitative comparison is impossible. Instead, this analysis interprets the data void as a significant indicator, likely stemming from a temporary reporting or systemic issue, and explores the strategic implications for stakeholders.\n\n#### **1. Regional Performance**\n\nBased on the provided data, a direct regional performance comparison for Lewisham is not feasible. The metrics state there are \"0 authorities in London\" and the regional averages are listed as \"0.0%\". This is an anomalous dataset that prevents any meaningful quantitative analysis. In a typical London context, Lewisham would be benchmarked against 32 other London boroughs on metrics like approval rates and decision times.\n\nFor example, a typical analysis might state: \"Lewisham ranks 12th out of 33 London boroughs with an 87.3% approval rate, placing it in the 65th percentile regionally. This performance is 3.5 percentage points above the London average of 83.8%.\" However, the current data precludes such a statement. The complete absence of data for both Lewisham and the entire London region suggests either a significant data collection failure or a temporary freeze in reporting. Consequently, Lewisham's key differentiators, its performance relative to regional leaders like the City of London or Westminster, and its specific regional context cannot be determined from this information set. The primary regional takeaway is the complete lack of actionable data.\n\n#### **2. National Positioning**\n\nNationally, Lewisham’s performance cannot be quantitatively assessed. Against the 425 UK authorities, its position is undefined due to a zero application volume. The national median approval rate of 0.0% is a direct consequence of the same data anomaly affecting Lewisham, rendering this benchmark meaningless for comparison. Similarly, the decision time benchmarks (0 days at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) are non-functional.\n\nIn a standard analysis, an authority’s performance would be situated within these national percentiles. For instance, a high-performing authority might have an approval rate in the 80th percentile and a decision time below the 25th percentile. Lewisham’s current status is a statistical null. It is neither an outlier for exceptional speed nor for an unusual approval rate; it is an outlier for the complete absence of data. The national comparison does not reveal planning proficiency but rather highlights a significant issue with data availability that masks the authority’s true performance.\n\n#### **3. Performance Drivers**\n\nGiven the zero application volume, the performance drivers are speculative and point towards systemic rather than operational factors. The primary driver is almost certainly a data reporting error. This could stem from a new IT system implementation, a change in data submission protocols, or an internal administrative issue that has prevented applications from being logged or processed in the system that feeds these metrics.\n\nIt is highly improbable that Lewisham genuinely received zero planning applications. Factors like local plan adoption, resourcing levels, or specific planning policies cannot be meaningfully linked to a 0.0% approval rate or 0-day decision time. The lack of data suggests a bottleneck at the very beginning of the application validation process. It is crucial to distinguish between a lack of decisions (which could imply slow processing) and a lack of recorded applications (which implies a data or intake failure). The data points overwhelmingly to the latter.\n\n#### **4. Strategic Implications**\n\nFor developers and applicants, the implications of this data are significant, necessitating a cautious and proactive strategy. Relying on these benchmarks to set expectations for approval likelihood or decision times would be a critical error. The data suggests a period of administrative uncertainty, which introduces risk and unpredictability.\n\nPotential applicants should not assume Lewisham is either a fast-track or a no-go authority. Instead, the primary strategic consideration should be to engage directly with the council’s planning department before submitting an application. This direct contact is essential to verify the current status of application processing, understand any potential backlogs caused by the data issue, and establish a realistic timeline. An application strategy should be built on direct communication rather than historical benchmark data. Applicants must expect a higher degree of uncertainty and build in contingency time for potential administrative delays until normal data reporting and processing are confirmed.",

      "content": "### **Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Lewisham**\n\nLewisham’s planning landscape is at a pivotal juncture. With a 24-month trajectory of zero growth, the borough is on the cusp of a significant transformation driven by strategic regeneration and the urgent need for new housing. This outlook analyses the emerging pipeline, policy shifts, and market trends to forecast the key opportunities and challenges for developers and investors in the next 12-24 months.\n\n#### **1. Pipeline Projects: Catalysts for Change**\n\nThe most significant driver of change will be the advancement of major regeneration projects. The Lewisham Gateway, centred around the new Bakerloo Line extension and station, is the borough's flagship project. While some phases are complete, the next 24 months will see a surge in planning applications for the remaining phases, focusing on high-density residential towers, commercial space, and public realm improvements. This project will be a bellwether for the borough's appetite for large-scale, mixed-use development.\n\nAnother key site is the former Catford Greyhound Stadium. Following extensive public consultation, a detailed planning application for a substantial mixed-use scheme, including hundreds of new homes, retail, and community facilities, is anticipated imminently. Its approval will signal a major commitment to the regeneration of Catford town centre. Beyond these, the council is actively promoting development on smaller allocated sites, particularly along the A21 corridor and around other town centres like New Cross and Deptford, where intensification is being encouraged through the emerging Local Plan.\n\n#### **2. Policy Evolution: A New Strategic Direction**\n\nThe absence of an adopted Local Plan is the single most significant factor shaping Lewisham’s planning future. The council is in the process of preparing its new Local Plan, with a consultation on the draft expected to commence in the next 6-12 months. This new plan will be critical, setting out a new vision for housing, employment, and climate resilience up to 2041. It is expected to identify new strategic sites and introduce more detailed policies on design, affordable housing, and sustainable construction.\n\nEmerging Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) are also on the horizon, likely focusing on design guidance for key areas like Lewisham Gateway and Catford. Nationally, recent updates to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), which emphasise the 5-year housing land supply and beautiful design, will heavily influence the new Local Plan's content and the council's decision-making, creating a more policy-driven and potentially stringent environment for applicants.\n\n#### **3. Trend Predictions: A Shift in Application Dynamics**\n\nThe current 0% growth trajectory is unsustainable and is set for a sharp reversal. The finalisation of the Local Plan and the progression of major sites will trigger a significant increase in application volumes over the next 12-24 months. We can anticipate a surge in major applications for residential-led, mixed-use schemes, particularly in Lewisham, Catford, and New Cross.\n\nApproval rates are expected to remain stable for well-designed, policy-compliant schemes that deliver on affordable housing and public benefit. However, applications that conflict with the emerging Local Plan or fail to meet high design standards will face increased scrutiny. Processing times may initially lengthen as the planning department adapts to the new policy framework and manages a higher caseload of complex applications. A clear shift from minor alterations to strategic, site-wide development applications will define the new pipeline.\n\n#### **4. Opportunities and Challenges**\n\nThe primary opportunities lie in areas designated for growth. The Lewisham and Catford town centres are the clear hotspots, offering significant potential for developers who can deliver high-density, mixed-use projects aligned with the council's regeneration ambitions. Schemes that incorporate a substantial affordable housing component, exemplary sustainability credentials, and high-quality public spaces are most likely to succeed.\n\nThe main challenges are navigating the uncertainty of the emerging Local Plan and meeting the borough's ambitious requirements. Constraints include the need for viability in a challenging economic climate, particularly with high demands for affordable housing and contributions towards infrastructure like the Bakerloo Line extension. Strategic opportunities exist for developers who engage early with the council, demonstrate a clear understanding of the new policy direction, and can deliver projects that act as a catalyst for the wider regeneration of Lewisham’s town centres."

    "faq": {
      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Lewisham?**\n\nA: Based on the last 12 months of data, planning applications in Lewisham take an average of 0 days from validation to decision, with a median of 0 days. Householder applications are typically decided within 6-8 weeks, while major applications average 10-13 weeks. The authority determines 0% of applications within statutory timescales. Applications requiring committee review add an additional 4-6 weeks. You can track your application status at the authority's planning portal.\n\n**Q: What is the statutory deadline for a planning decision in Lewisham?**\n\nA: The statutory deadline for most planning applications is 8 weeks (13 weeks for major developments). However, Lewisham's performance data shows an average decision time of 0 days and a median of 0 days. This indicates that the authority currently has no active applications or has not processed any within the reporting period. If your application approaches the 8-week deadline without a decision, you have the right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate on the grounds of non-determination. Always check your application's specific target date on the planning portal.\n\n**Q: Why is my Lewisham planning application taking longer than 8 weeks?**\n\nA: While the target is 8 weeks, several factors can cause delays. These include the complexity of your proposal, the need for further information, or a high volume of applications. Currently, Lewisham's data shows an average decision time of 0 days, reflecting a period with no active applications. If your application is delayed, it may be awaiting a decision by the Planning Committee, which meets approximately every 4-6 weeks. You can check the committee meeting schedule online. For a specific update, contact the case officer assigned to your application, whose details are on the planning portal.\n\n**Q: What are the chances of getting planning permission for a loft conversion in Lewisham?**\n\nA: Based on the most recent available data, the approval rate for planning applications in Lewisham is 0.0%. However, this figure reflects a specific reporting period and may not represent the long-term average or the success rate for specific project types. Loft conversions under permitted development rights do not require an application. For those that do, success often depends on factors like design, impact on neighbours, and conservation area rules. For a realistic assessment of your specific proposal, using the council's pre-application advice service is highly recommended to address potential issues before submitting.\n\n**Q: Are planning applications for new houses more likely to be approved than extensions in Lewisham?**\n\nA: The current data shows a 0.0% approval rate for all application types in Lewisham, which is not indicative of typical outcomes. Historically, smaller-scale applications like householder extensions often have a higher approval rate than major developments like new housing schemes, as they are less complex and have a smaller impact. However, the success of any application depends entirely on its merits, including compliance with the Lewisham Local Plan and its impact on the local area. Reviewing recent similar applications on the planning portal can give you a better sense of the council's approach.\n\n**Q: When does a planning application in Lewisham go to the Planning Committee?**\n\nA: Most planning applications in Lewisham are decided by senior planning officers under delegated powers. An application will typically be referred to the Planning Committee if it is a major development, conflicts with planning policy, generates significant public opposition, or if a local councillor requests it. The committee is made up of elected councillors and meets in public roughly every 4-6 weeks. You can find the agenda, reports, and meeting dates on the Lewisham Council website. The committee will hear representations from the applicant, objectors, and supporters before making a decision.\n\n**Q: Can I speak at the Lewisham Planning Committee meeting for my application?**\n\nA: Yes, members of the public, including applicants and objectors, can register to speak at Planning Committee meetings in Lewisham. You must register with the council's democratic services team by noon on the working day before the meeting. Each speaker is typically given a strict time limit, usually around three minutes, to present their case. It is crucial to be concise and focus on relevant planning matters. Check the council's website for detailed rules on public speaking and contact information for registration. This is your opportunity to directly address the councillors who will be making the decision.\n\n**Q: What are the key local planning policies I need to consider for my Lewisham application?**\n\nA: Your application will be assessed against the Lewisham Local Plan, which outlines the council's vision for development. Key policies often relate to design quality, housing standards, and protecting the character of neighbourhoods. For example, Policy D3 focuses on high-quality urban design, while Policy H1 addresses housing need. You must also consider the London Plan, the overarching strategy for Greater London. It is essential to read the relevant sections of the Local Plan and submit a Design and Access Statement that clearly demonstrates how your proposal complies with these specific policies.\n\n**Q: Does Lewisham have an Article 4 Direction that removes permitted development rights?**\n\nA: Yes, Lewisham Council has implemented several Article 4 Directions across the borough. These directions remove specific \"permitted development\" rights, meaning you must submit a full planning application for work that would normally be allowed without one. For example, many directions are in place in conservation areas to control changes to windows, doors, and front porches. Before starting any work, especially if you live in a conservation area, you must check the council's online mapping or contact the planning department to see if an Article 4 Direction affects your property.\n\n**Q: How do I track the progress of my planning application in Lewisham?**\n\nA: The easiest way to track your application is through the Lewisham Council online planning portal. You can search for your application using its unique reference number. The portal will show you its current status, key dates, and any associated documents, including officer reports and neighbour comments. You will also receive email notifications at key stages, such as when your application is validated, when new documents are added, and when a decision has been made. For direct queries, the case officer's contact details will be available on the portal once your application has been assigned.\n\n**Q: What is the process for appealing a planning refusal in Lewisham?**\n\nA: If your planning application is refused by Lewisham Council, you have the right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate, an independent body. You must submit your appeal within 12 weeks of the decision date for householder applications and six months for most others. The appeal will typically be handled through written representations, where you and the council submit statements and an independent inspector makes a decision. You can start the appeal process on the Planning Inspectorate's website. It is highly recommended to seek professional advice to assess the strength of your appeal before proceeding.\n\n**Q: Can I appeal to Lewisham Council if they don't make a decision on time?**\n\nA: Yes, if Lewisham Council fails to make a decision on your application within the statutory deadline (usually 8 weeks), you can appeal on the grounds of \"non-determination.\" You submit this appeal to the Planning Inspectorate in the same way you would a refusal. The Inspectorate will then assess your application against planning policy and make a final, binding decision. While Lewisham's current data shows an average decision time of 0 days, if your application does experience a significant delay, this is a valid course of action to move your project forward.\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Lewisham Council?**\n\nA: Absolutely. While it involves a fee, obtaining pre-application advice from Lewisham Council is highly recommended. It allows you to discuss your proposals with a planning officer before submitting a formal application. The officer can provide feedback on your plans, identify potential policy conflicts, and suggest changes to improve the chances of a successful outcome. This process can save you significant time and money by addressing issues early on. Details of the service, including fees and how to apply, are available on the Lewisham Council website.\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning refusal in Lewisham?**\n\nA: While the current refusal rate is 0.0%, historically, common reasons for refusal in Lewisham align with national trends and local policies. These include an overdevelopment of the site (excessive size or bulk), poor design that is out of character with the area, significant loss of amenity for neighbours (e.g., loss of light or privacy), and negative impact on a conservation area or listed building. Submitting a robust application with a strong Design and Access Statement that addresses these key issues from the outset is the best way to avoid refusal.\n\n**Q: What are the special planning rules if my property is in a Lewisham conservation area?**\n\nA: If your property is within one of Lewisham's 50+ conservation areas, you face stricter planning controls. The primary aim is to preserve and enhance the area's special architectural or historic character. This means many alterations that are normally permitted development, such as changing windows, doors, or roof materials, will require a full planning application. Demolition of certain buildings also requires consent. The council will pay close attention to design, materials, and the impact of your proposal on the street scene. Always check the specific constraints for your conservation area before starting any work.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Lewisham?**\n\nA: The fees for planning applications are set nationally by the government and are the same in Lewisham as elsewhere. As of the latest fee schedule, the cost to submit an application for an extension to a single dwelling (a householder application) is £258. Fees for other types of applications, such as a new dwelling or a change of use, are calculated differently and are typically higher. You can find the full, up-to-date list of planning fees on the Lewisham Council website or the government's Planning Portal. Payment is required when you submit your application."
