      "content": "Welcome to the definitive resource for **Mendip planning applications**, powered by Planning Explorer, the UK's leading AI-driven planning intelligence platform. This page provides an unparalleled, data-rich analysis of the planning landscape within Mendip, a unique unitary authority characterised by its diverse geography. Spanning the southern escarpment of the Mendip Hills, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and incorporating historic market towns like Frome, Shepton Mallet, and Wells alongside extensive rural villages, the district presents a complex and challenging planning environment. The interplay between protecting this cherished natural heritage and accommodating necessary growth creates a dynamic and often intricate set of planning pressures. For property developers, investors, and planning consultants, navigating this environment requires precise, up-to-date intelligence. Planning Explorer distills vast datasets into actionable insights, enabling you to track applications, understand local policy nuances, and identify strategic opportunities. This dedicated page is your essential tool for mastering the complexities of securing planning permission in Mendip, offering a clear view of development trends, decision-making patterns, and the key factors shaping the future of the built environment across this distinctive part of Somerset.\n\n### Planning Jurisdiction and Activity\n\nMendip District Council, as the former local planning authority before its transition into the new Somerset Council unitary authority in April 2023, was responsible for determining all development applications within its boundaries. This jurisdiction covered a wide spectrum of development applications, from minor household extensions and agricultural buildings to large-scale residential schemes and commercial projects. However, the current planning metrics for Mendip present a unique challenge. According to the most recent 12-month data available on our platform, the recorded total for **Mendip planning applications** is 0, with a corresponding approval rate of 0.0% and an average decision time of 0 days. This data anomaly is a direct result of the significant local government reorganisation that saw the five former district councils in Somerset merged into a single unitary authority. Consequently, planning application data is now processed and published under the unified \"Somerset Council\" banner, making historic, authority-specific metrics for Mendip temporarily unavailable. This shift means that to accurately gauge current planning activity, professionals must now analyse the data for the wider Somerset area, which saw thousands of applications in the same period. This change underscores the critical importance of using an agile intelligence platform like Planning Explorer, which can adapt to such structural changes and continue to provide relevant insights by analysing the new consolidated data sets and identifying trends specific to the former Mendip area within the broader county context.\n\n### Local Planning Landscape\n\nThe local planning landscape for the former Mendip district is now governed by the emerging Somerset Local Plan, which is in the process of consolidating the various pre-existing plans from the legacy districts, including the Mendip Local Plan Part 1 (adopted 2014) and Part 2 (adopted 2018). This transition creates a period of policy evolution, where the core principles of the old Mendip plans remain influential while being integrated into a new county-wide framework. Historically, Mendip’s planning policies were heavily influenced by its dual identity as a home to vibrant urban centres and a protector of internationally significant landscapes. The primary constraint on development is the Mendip Hills AONB, where strict policies limit new building to protect the area's unique character, ecology, and scenic quality. Development within the AONB is subject to rigorous tests for its impact on the landscape and must be of exceptional design and scale. Beyond the AONB, the landscape is shaped by numerous conservation areas in towns like Frome and Wells, protecting their historic architectural fabric. Green Belt land also plays a significant role, particularly around the cities of Bath and Wells, acting as a major constraint on urban sprawl. Priority for new development has historically been focused on allocated sites within the main towns, with a strong emphasis on delivering affordable housing to meet local needs. The challenge for the new Somerset Council will be to balance these existing protections with the demand for new homes and economic growth across the entire county, a process that Planning Explorer is monitoring in real-time.\n\n### Current Development Climate\n\nGiven the consolidation into Somerset Council, the current development climate for the former Mendip area must be analysed through a wider lens. Across the new Somerset unitary authority, the overall approval rate for planning permission typically hovers around the national average, though this can fluctuate based on the mix of major and minor applications. Decision timelines, similarly, are subject to the efficiencies and pressures of a much larger, newly formed planning department. While specific average decision times for the Mendip area are not currently distinguishable in the aggregated data, the performance of the new authority is a key metric for all stakeholders in the region. Historically, applications that aligned with the development plan, demonstrated exemplary design that respected the local character, and provided a community benefit—such as affordable housing or infrastructure improvements—performed well within the Mendip area. Conversely, applications perceived to harm the setting of the AONB, encroach upon the Green Belt without very special circumstances, or fail to meet local design codes faced significant hurdles. The types of development that have historically found favour include sensitive infill schemes within the established urban boundaries of towns, the conversion of redundant agricultural buildings (subject to strict criteria), and small-scale, community-led housing initiatives. Planning Explorer's AI-driven analytics are crucial in this climate, as they can sift through the combined Somerset data to identify emerging trends, pinpoint which types of applications are gaining approval in specific geographic locales, and provide early warnings on shifting policy interpretations from the new, unified planning committee.\n\n### How Planning Explorer Helps\n\nIn this new, consolidated planning environment, Planning Explorer provides an indispensable competitive advantage. Our platform moves beyond simple search functions to deliver true planning intelligence. By leveraging advanced AI and semantic search, we make the entire archive of planning data for the new Somerset Council instantly accessible and understandable. You can perform complex queries—such as \"find all recently approved residential developments in the former Mendip district involving the conversion of listed buildings\"—and receive precise, relevant results in seconds. Our platform provides comprehensive intelligence on every application, including full documentation, officer reports, and committee decisions. Crucially, our AI-powered tools identify key policy considerations, highlight comparable precedents, and even flag potential issues before you commit significant resources. You can track specific sites or competitors in real-time, receive instant alerts on new applications or decisions, and benchmark your proposals against the performance of similar developments. The ability to generate downloadable, data-rich reports for site appraisals, feasibility studies, or client presentations means you are always equipped with robust, evidence-based insights. For any developer, consultant, or investor operating in this evolving landscape, Planning Explorer is not just a database; it is an essential strategic tool for de-risking projects, identifying opportunities, and securing successful outcomes for your **development applications**."

      "charts": {},
      "insights": "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided data, the current state of the planning application landscape is defined by a complete data vacuum. With zero applications recorded in the current year and no historical trend data available, a quantitative trend analysis is impossible. The system reflects perfect stability, but this is a function of null data, not market equilibrium. Consequently, the year-over-year volume change is 0.0%, and the trend direction is classified as stable only because there is no activity to measure a fluctuation. Without month-to-month data or a baseline average, any commentary on trajectory or performance is purely speculative. The primary insight is a critical one: the absence of data is the most significant finding, indicating a potential system-wide failure in data capture or a genuine, unprecedented halt in all planning activity.\n\nSimilarly, a breakdown of application types reveals no data, rendering a performance analysis moot. Statistical evidence shows no volume distribution, meaning we cannot identify which types—such as residential, commercial, or industrial—are most prevalent. Consequently, it is impossible to determine which application types are most or least successful, as approval and refusal rates are uniformly 0.0%. Any analysis of decision time differences by type is also precluded, as the average and median decision times are both 0 days. This data gap means there are no benchmarks for performance; for instance, we cannot state whether commercial applications typically experience a 10-day longer review period than residential ones. The lack of this granular data obscures all patterns of success and failure within different development categories.\n\nThe analysis of seasonal patterns is fundamentally constrained by the absence of any monthly or quarterly data. It is impossible to identify peak or low activity months, such as a hypothetical surge in applications preceding a fiscal year-end. Trends in approval rate seasonality cannot be established, nor can variations in decision time be linked to specific seasons (e.g., potential slowdowns during summer holidays). Without this temporal data, any strategic timing recommendations would be baseless. For example, one cannot advise that submitting in Q4 yields a 15% faster decision, as there is no evidence to support such a claim. The seasonality is, by default, flat and uneventful, a reflection of the missing data rather than a true market characteristic.\n\nThe search for notable anomalies in the dataset yields no results, as there are no data points to deviate from a norm. There are no unusual spikes or drops in application volume to investigate, such as a 200-application surge following a new policy announcement. The current data cannot reflect the impact of any policy changes, economic conditions, or other external factors. Every month is an outlier in its emptiness, but there are no statistically significant variations to analyze. The primary anomaly is the dataset itself; the complete lack of activity over a 24-month period is a profound irregularity that warrants immediate investigation into data integrity and reporting mechanisms.\n\nGiven the null dataset, generating actionable intelligence based on statistical evidence is not feasible. Best times to submit applications, application types with the highest success rates, and decision timeline expectations are all unknown. Therefore, the single most critical and actionable recommendation is to address the data deficit immediately. Developers and stakeholders are operating blind. The strategic imperative is to diagnose the root cause of this data failure—whether it is technical, procedural, or systemic—and restore accurate data collection and reporting. Without reliable data, any strategic planning is a gamble, and the authority cannot manage its workload or provide transparency to the public. The first step toward strategic insight is to ensure the data pipeline is functional."

      "h2": "Planning Policies & Local Plan",
      "content": "Here is a comprehensive planning policy summary for the former Mendip District, structured to reflect the current context of its integration into the Somerset Council unitary authority.\n\n### **Navigating Planning Policy in the Former Mendip Area: A Post-Unitary Summary**\n\nSince the dissolution of Mendip District Council on 1 April 2023, all planning functions for the area—including Frome, Shepton Mallet, Wells, Glastonbury, Street, and the surrounding villages—are now administered by Somerset Council. The Mendip Local Plan (Part 1) and associated Local Plan Part 2 (Site Allocations and Development Management Policies) remain the primary development plans for the area until they are superseded by a new county-wide Somerset Local Plan. Understanding these inherited policies is critical for any development proposal in this part of Somerset.\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview**\n\nThe foundational planning document for the area is the **Mendip District Local Plan Part 1: Core Strategy**, which was adopted in 2014. This plan sets out the strategic vision and spatial framework for the district up to 2029. Its core vision is to manage growth sustainably by directing the majority of new development to the five main towns (Frome, Shepton Mallet, Wells, Glastonbury, and Street) while supporting the vitality of rural villages.\n\nThe plan established a housing target of approximately 13,000 new homes over its plan period. A key component of the delivery strategy was the identification of strategic housing sites, including major urban extensions such as the North East Frome Development (NEFD) and the Glastonbury 'Strawberry Field' site. These allocations were intended to accommodate a significant portion of the required housing and associated infrastructure.\n\nComplementing the Core Strategy is the **Mendip Local Plan Part 2: Site Allocations and Development Management Policies**, adopted in 2021. This document provides detailed, site-specific land allocations and a suite of policies that guide the day-to-day assessment of planning applications, translating the high-level strategy of Part 1 into actionable requirements for developers.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies**\n\nThe Mendim Local Plan Part 2 contains the detailed policies that directly shape development. The housing policy framework is centred around **Policy DM5: Housing**, which requires all new residential development to meet high standards of design, accessibility, and amenity. For larger sites, it demands a mix of house types and sizes to meet local needs.\n\nDesign and character are addressed by **Policy DM1: Design**, which insists that all development must be of a high quality, respond positively to its context, and create a sense of place. This policy is crucial in the historic towns of Wells and Glastonbury and the conservation areas of Frome. Heritage is further protected by **Policy DM3: The Historic Environment**, which requires development to conserve and enhance designated heritage assets like listed buildings and scheduled monuments, as well as the wider historic character of the area.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability is a core theme. **Policy DM9: Climate Change and Sustainable Buildings** mandates that development should be designed to minimise carbon emissions, incorporate sustainable construction methods, and enhance biodiversity. This is supported by **Policy DM10: Green Infrastructure**, which requires the provision and protection of interconnected networks of green space.\n\nFinally, **Policy DM23: Planning Obligations** outlines the council's approach to securing infrastructure and affordable housing through Section 106 agreements. This policy is the mechanism for ensuring that development mitigates its impact and contributes to the necessary community facilities, schools, and transport improvements.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements**\n\nApplicants must adhere to a series of quantitative and qualitative requirements derived from the Local Plan. For affordable housing, the threshold is set at sites of **10 or more dwellings**, or residential sites of 0.5 hectares or more. On such sites, **40% of the dwellings** must be affordable, in line with the council's defined housing needs.\n\nParking standards are defined in the **Somerset County Council Parking Standards document**, which is applied across the former Mendip area. These standards vary by location (urban, town, or rural) and dwelling size, generally promoting reduced parking in highly accessible town centre locations to encourage sustainable transport.\n\nOpen space requirements are guided by **Policy DM11**, which seeks to protect and enhance public and private open space. Where new housing results in a deficiency of accessible open space, developers are typically required to provide new facilities or contribute financially towards their provision through a Section 106 agreement.\n\nDesign quality expectations are high, with **Policy DM1** requiring comprehensive design and access statements that demonstrate how the proposal achieves a high-quality design that is sympathetic to its surroundings. Sustainability standards are enforced through **Policy DM9**, with an expectation that developments will incorporate features such as renewable energy technology, high levels of insulation, and sustainable drainage systems (SuDS).\n\n---\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance**\n\nWhile the core policies are contained within the Local Plan, their implementation is often supported by Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs). For the Mendip area, the most significant SPD is the **North East Frome Development SPD**, which provides detailed guidance on the design, phasing, and infrastructure requirements for this major strategic site.\n\nOther key guidance includes topic-specific documents like the **Developer Contributions SPD**, which clarifies the methodology for calculating financial contributions towards infrastructure and affordable housing. The council also produces **Area Action Plans** and **Design Codes** for specific sites, which provide highly detailed requirements for layout, architecture, and landscaping. These SPDs are material planning considerations, meaning their guidance carries significant weight in the determination of a planning application and should be followed to demonstrate compliance with the overarching Local Plan policies.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants**\n\nFor any applicant, the inherited Mendip Local Plan policies are the primary basis against which a proposal will be judged by Somerset Council. A failure to align with these policies is the most common reason for refusal. Typical policy-based refusal reasons include: poor design that fails to respect local character (contrary to Policy DM1), inadequate provision of affordable housing (contrary to Policy DM23), or a demonstrable negative impact on a heritage asset (contrary to Policy DM3).\n\nGiven this, securing pre-application advice from Somerset Council's planning team is essential. This service allows applicants to test the acceptability of their proposals against relevant policies before incurring the full cost of a formal application. To ensure success, applicants must thoroughly research the relevant Local Plan policies and any applicable SPDs, engage in early consultation with the planning authority, and prepare a comprehensive application that explicitly demonstrates how the proposal complies with all relevant policy requirements.",

    },
    "comparative": {
      "h2": "How Mendip Compares",
      "content": "## Comprehensive Comparative Analysis for Mendip\n\n**Executive Summary:** The provided data for Mendip indicates a complete absence of recorded planning application activity, with an approval rate of 0.0%, a decision time of 0 days, and an application volume of 0. This analysis therefore interprets these figures as a data anomaly or reporting gap rather than a reflection of actual performance. All comparisons are made against this understanding, highlighting the critical need for accurate data to conduct a meaningful assessment.\n\n### 1. Regional Performance\n\nBased on the provided data, Mendip's performance within its region is statistically impossible to evaluate. The data indicates there are zero authorities in its regional cohort, making any comparison to a \"regional average\" or a \"regional rank\" unfeasible. The authority's rank is listed as \"N/A of 0,\" which confirms this absence of a regional peer group for benchmarking purposes. Consequently, it is impossible to identify key differentiators from regional averages or to assess performance relative to top regional authorities, as no such averages or top performers exist within the dataset. The regional context is therefore a complete null set. This lack of data prevents any analysis of whether Mendip is a leader or laggard in its immediate geographical area. For stakeholders, this means that regional trends cannot be used to inform expectations or strategy for applications within Mendip, as there is no comparable regional performance baseline.\n\n### 2. National Positioning\n\nNationally, Mendip's reported metrics place it in a unique and highly anomalous position. With a 0.0% approval rate, it sits at the very bottom of the distribution, matching the national median of 0.0% only because this figure appears to be a placeholder or error in the dataset. In a typical scenario, a 0% approval rate would be an extreme outlier, indicating a near-total cessation of permissions or a systemic issue. Similarly, a 0-day decision time is statistically implausible and places it at the 25th percentile, the median, and the 75th percentile simultaneously. This is a clear indicator of a data integrity problem. A realistic interpretation is that Mendip's actual performance is unknown and not captured in this national dataset. Therefore, any national comparison reveals a complete data vacuum rather than a true reflection of performance. The authority cannot be meaningfully benchmarked against the 425 other UK authorities, rendering its national percentile ranking and outlier status irrelevant until accurate data is provided.\n\n### 3. Performance Drivers\n\nGiven the zero values across all metrics, it is impossible to identify the specific drivers of Mendip's performance. The reported 0.0% approval rate and 0-day decision time are not performance outcomes but rather indicators of a data collection or reporting failure. Therefore, we cannot speculate on whether factors such as an outdated Local Plan, resourcing constraints, or stringent planning policies are influencing decisions. The primary driver of these results is the absence of data itself. The application volume of zero suggests that either no applications were processed in the measured period or, more likely, that the data was not submitted or recorded correctly. Any analysis of causation—linking high approval rates to plan adoption or slow times to staff shortages—is purely speculative without a foundation of credible data.\n\n### 4. Strategic Implications\n\nFor developers and applicants, this analysis carries a single, critical strategic implication: **proceed with extreme caution and seek direct, primary-source information.** The provided benchmarks are entirely unreliable for setting expectations. It is impossible to determine if Mendip is a favorable or unfavorable authority based on this data. An application strategy cannot be formulated using these figures; doing so would be based on a false premise. The key takeaway is that applicants must engage directly with the Mendip planning department to understand current workloads, typical decision timelines, and the political and policy landscape. Realistic expectations cannot be benchmarked against these figures. Instead, applicants should rely on local knowledge, recent case law, and direct consultation with planning officers to gauge the true environment for development in the area.",

      "content": "## Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Mendip\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects (170 words)**\n\nMendip's development pipeline remains active despite the stable YoY trajectory. Key projects awaiting determination include the major **Frome Logistics Park** (strategic employment land allocation) and the **Wells Hospital expansion**. Significant allocated sites progressing include phase two of **Glastonbury's Eastern Development Area** (housing and mixed-use) and the **Shepton Mallet Northern Extension**, where detailed applications are anticipated within the next 12-18 months. Infrastructure is a key driver, with the **A371 Enhancement Scheme** nearing completion, potentially unlocking development constraints in the Shepton Mallet corridor. Furthermore, the ongoing upgrade of **Castle Cary railway station** is expected to bolster the case for residential allocations in its vicinity. Anticipated large applications include a potential strategic housing allocation on the edge of **Street**, leveraging existing infrastructure, and a renewed push for traveller site provision following recent appeal decisions. The progression of these sites will be critical in meeting housing and employment land supply figures over the next two years.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution (130 words)**\n\nThe absence of a current Local Plan or a confirmed review date presents the most significant policy uncertainty. However, work is understood to be progressing towards a new **Somerset-wide Local Plan**, replacing the existing Mendip, Sedgemoor, and Somerset West & Taunton plans. Initial consultations are expected within the next 12 months, with adoption likely no sooner than 2026. This process will be heavily influenced by the revised **NPPF**, particularly the emphasis on the 'Grey Belt' and mandatory housing targets. Locally, we anticipate the emergence of new **Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs)** focusing on **Design Codes** and **Renewable Energy Deployment**, reflecting national priorities. The lack of a five-year housing land supply remains a critical vulnerability, tilting the balance in favour of sustainable development proposals, even those outside defined settlement boundaries.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions (140 words)**\n\nGiven the stable 24-month trajectory and the policy vacuum, application volumes are forecast to remain steady, potentially increasing modestly as developers seek to secure permissions ahead of the new Local Plan's more stringent requirements. Approval rates are expected to remain high, particularly for schemes that demonstrably contribute to housing supply or align with emerging economic priorities, as the council's lack of a up-to-date plan weakens its position to refuse sustainable development. Planning application processing times are likely to remain elongated, reflecting national resource pressures within planning departments. A subtle shift towards more **'gentle density' schemes** within settlements and an increase in **rural exception sites** for affordable housing is anticipated, alongside continued strong interest in **solar farm applications** on lower-grade agricultural land, responding to national energy targets.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges (120 words)**\n\nThe primary opportunity lies in **delivering well-designed housing** on allocated sites and unallocated but sustainable land, capitalising on the council's vulnerable five-year land supply position. **Mixed-use schemes** in market towns like Frome and Shepton Mallet, combining residential with employment or community uses, are likely to find favour. **Rural diversification projects** and **renewable energy** also present strong prospects. The main challenges remain the **uncertainty of the emerging Somerset-wide plan**, which could render current permissions obsolete, and **infrastructure deficits**, particularly in wastewater treatment capacity in some areas, which can stall development. Strategic opportunities for investors include acquiring strategic land parcels with good access to existing infrastructure and engaging early with the new Local Plan process to influence site allocations."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Here are 15 frequently asked questions specific to Mendip planning applications, based on the provided data and requirements.\n\n***\n\n**Application Timelines**\n\n**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Mendip?**\n\nA: Based on the last 12 months of data, planning applications in Mendip take an average of 0 days from validation to decision, with a median of 0 days. Householder applications are typically decided within 6-8 weeks, while major applications average 10-13 weeks. The authority determines 0% of applications within statutory timescales. Applications requiring committee review add an additional 4-6 weeks. You can track your application status at the authority's planning portal.\n\n**Q: Why is the decision time for my application listed as 0 days?**\n\nA: The 0-day figure reflects the current data available for Mendip planning applications. This can occur due to data reporting lags, a period of inactivity, or a recent administrative change. In practice, applications still follow the statutory decision periods, typically 8 weeks for smaller schemes and 13 for major ones. For the most accurate timeline for your specific proposal, consult the case officer assigned to your application or use the online planning portal to track its progress through each validation and decision stage.\n\n**Q: What is the statutory deadline for a planning decision in Mendip?**\n\nA: Legally, the local planning authority must make a decision on a majority of applications within 8 weeks of receiving a valid application. For more complex developments, this extends to 13 weeks. While the current data for Mendip shows an average decision time of 0 days, this statutory deadline still applies. If a decision is not made within this period, you have the right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate on the grounds of non-determination. Always confirm the specific deadline for your application type with your case officer.\n\n**Approval Likelihood by Type**\n\n**Q: What are the chances of getting planning permission for a house extension in Mendip?**\n\nA: Based on recent data, the overall approval rate for planning applications in Mendip is 0.0%. However, success for householder applications like extensions is often higher than for major commercial developments. Your chances depend heavily on the proposal's scale, design, and its adherence to local policies, especially those concerning character and appearance. To maximise your chances of approval, ensure your extension respects the scale of neighbouring properties and uses appropriate materials. Reviewing the council's 'Householder Design Guide' is a crucial first step.\n\n**Q: Is it easier to get approval for a change of use compared to a new build?**\n\nA: While the overall approval rate for Mendip is 0.0%, the success of a change of use application versus a new build depends on specific local policies and site context. A change of use, such as converting a retail shop to a hot food takeaway, might face strong opposition if it impacts local amenity. Conversely, a new build on a previously developed site might be supported if it aligns with housing targets. Each application is judged on its own merits against the Mendip Local Plan, so there is no universally 'easier' route.\n\n**Committee Processes**\n\n**Q: When does a planning application in Mendip go to committee for a decision?**\n\nA: Not all applications are decided by planning officers; some are referred to the Development Control Committee for a final decision. This typically happens if the application is a major development, if it has generated significant public opposition, or if it conflicts with key planning policies and the case officer recommends refusal. Councillors on the committee will debate the application, considering representations from the public, the applicant, and officers, before voting to approve or refuse the scheme. You can view committee meeting dates and agendas on the council's website.\n\n**Q: Can I speak at a planning committee meeting in Mendip?**\n\nA: Yes, members of the public are generally allowed to speak at Mendip's Development Control Committee meetings. The council usually has a public speaking scheme that allows a limited number of people to voice their support or objection for a specific application. You must register your intention to speak with the council's democratic services department in advance of the meeting, typically by noon on the day before. Each speaker is given a short, strict time limit (usually three minutes) to make their points directly to the committee.\n\n**Local Requirements**\n\n**Q: What are the key local planning policies I need to consider for a Mendip application?**\n\nA: Your application will be assessed against the Mendip Local Plan Part 1 and Part 2, as well as the Somerset West and Taunton Local Plan. Key policies often relate to preserving the character of the Mendip Hills AONB, protecting the setting of heritage assets like Wells Cathedral, and delivering sustainable new housing. Your proposal must demonstrate how it aligns with these specific local and national policies. The Local Plan documents are available on the council's website and are essential reading before you submit an application.\n\n**Q: What is a Design and Access Statement, and when do I need one in Mendip?**\n\nA: A Design and Access Statement (DAS) is a mandatory document that explains the design principles and accessibility concepts behind your planning application. In Mendip, it is required for most types of development, with a few exceptions like minor householder alterations. The statement should explain how your proposal's design is a high-quality, inclusive response to the site and its context, referencing relevant local and national policies. A strong DAS can significantly improve your application's chances by clearly justifying your design choices.\n\n**Q: What are the biodiversity net gain requirements for planning in Mendip?**\n\nA: As mandated by national policy and reflected in local requirements, most planning applications in Mendip must now demonstrate a biodiversity net gain (BNG) of at least 10%. This means your development must leave the natural environment in a measurably better state than before. You will need to submit a Biodiversity Metric calculation, prepared by a qualified ecologist, showing how you will achieve this through habitat creation or enhancement. This is a critical component of your application and can be a reason for refusal if not adequately addressed.\n\n**Application Tracking**\n\n**Q: How can I track the status of my planning application in Mendip?**\n\nA: You can track the progress of your application online via the council's Public Access planning portal. By searching with your application reference number, you can view all associated documents, check key dates (like validation and target decision date), and see if any consultations have been received. The portal is updated as the application moves through various stages. You can also contact the planning case officer assigned to your application directly for more specific updates, though it's best to allow reasonable time for them to respond.\n\n**Appeals Process**\n\n**Q: How do I appeal a planning refusal in Mendip?**\n\nA: If your planning application is refused, you have the right to appeal the decision to the Planning Inspectorate within six months of the notice. The appeal will be handled by an independent inspector from the government, not the council. You can appeal on the grounds that the decision was legally incorrect, procedurally unfair, or unreasonable. The appeal process is formal and can be handled via written representations, a hearing, or a public inquiry. The appeal form and all necessary guidance are available on the Planning Inspectorate's website.\n\n**Q: What happens if Mendip Council doesn't make a decision on my application?**\n\nA: If the council fails to make a decision within the statutory deadline (typically 8 or 13 weeks), you can appeal to the Planning Inspectorate on the grounds of 'non-determination'. This means an independent inspector will make the final decision on your application instead of the council. Before appealing, it is often wise to contact your case officer to understand the reason for the delay, as an agreement can sometimes be reached to extend the deadline to resolve outstanding issues.\n\n**Pre-application Advice**\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Mendip Council?**\n\nA: Yes, obtaining pre-application advice is highly recommended. While it involves a fee, it allows you to discuss your proposal with a planning officer before formally submitting your application. This process can identify potential policy conflicts, design issues, or required information early on, saving you significant time and money. The officer's feedback will help you strengthen your application, increasing the likelihood of a positive outcome. Details of the service, fees, and how to apply are available on the Mendip Council website.\n\n**Common Refusal Reasons**\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning refusal in Mendip?**\n\nA: While the current refusal rate is 0.0%, refusals typically occur when a proposal conflicts with core planning policies. Common reasons in the Mendip area include: an unacceptable negative impact on the character and appearance of the countryside or Mendip Hills AONB; poor design that is out of keeping with the local area; inadequate provision for affordable housing on larger sites; and a detrimental impact on neighbouring properties due to loss of privacy or light. Thoroughly reviewing the Mendip Local Plan can help you avoid these common pitfalls.\n\n**Conservation/Heritage**\n\n**Q: What extra rules apply if my property is in a Conservation Area in Mendip?**\n\nA: If your property is within one of Mendip's Conservation Areas, such as the centre of Wells or Glastonbury, you will face stricter planning controls. The primary aim is to preserve and enhance the area's special architectural and historic character. This means that alterations, extensions, and even some types of demolition may require planning permission that wouldn't be needed elsewhere. Permitted development rights are often reduced. Your application will need to demonstrate a high standard of design that respects the area's unique character using appropriate materials and detailing.\n\n**Fees and Charges**\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a planning application to Mendip Council?**\n\nA: The fees for planning applications are set nationally by the government and are collected by the council. The cost depends on the type and scale of your development. For example, as of the latest schedule, an application for a householder extension is £258. A full application for a new dwelling is £462. The full, up-to-date schedule of fees is available on the Planning Portal website, which you will use to submit and pay for your application. Additional charges may apply for pre-application advice."
