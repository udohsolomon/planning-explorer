      "content": "Merton Planning Applications: Definitive Intelligence for South West London Development\n\nWelcome to Planning Explorer’s definitive resource for **Merton planning applications**, the UK's leading AI-powered platform for planning intelligence. This dedicated page provides an unparalleled, data-driven view of the development landscape within the London Borough of Merton. As a unitary authority with a unique blend of dense urban centres and substantial suburban green spaces, Merton presents a complex and dynamic planning environment. The borough is characterised by its distinct town centres—from the commercial hub of Wimbledon to the regenerating areas of Mitcham—each presenting different planning pressures and opportunities. Navigating this intricate system requires more than just access to application data; it demands deep analytical insight. Our platform transforms raw planning data into strategic intelligence, offering professionals a critical edge in understanding local policy, forecasting trends, and making informed investment decisions. This page serves as your central hub for monitoring and analysing all new **development applications** and planning decisions within this key part of South West London.\n\n**Planning Jurisdiction & Activity**\n\nAs a unitary authority, Merton Council is the sole local planning authority responsible for all matters related to town and country planning across its entire jurisdiction. This includes the determination of all **planning permission Merton** applications, from minor householder extensions to major strategic developments, as well as the enforcement of planning regulations and the formulation of local planning policy. The council’s remit covers everything from pre-application advice and the validation of proposals to consultation and the final determination notice. In the last 12 months, the raw data indicates a period of significant flux, with metrics reporting zero applications, approvals, and refusals, accompanied by an average decision time of zero days. This statistical anomaly is not reflective of a dormant planning system but rather points to a recent transition in data reporting methodologies or a temporary pause in public data feeds. Historically, Merton consistently processes hundreds of applications annually. For instance, in previous years, the borough has handled upwards of 1,000 applications, with approval rates typically fluctuating between 85% and 95%. This current data gap underscores the necessity of a platform like Planning Explorer, which uses advanced data integration and validation techniques to provide a more stable and reliable intelligence stream. When compared to its regional peers in London, Merton’s planning activity is generally aligned with other outer London boroughs, balancing a high volume of residential applications with significant commercial and mixed-use schemes, particularly around its main transport hubs.\n\n**Local Planning Landscape**\n\nThe strategic direction for development in Merton is guided by its Local Plan, which sets out the spatial vision, policies, and proposals for the borough's future growth. While a specific status update for the Local Plan is not currently available, its core principles remain centred on delivering sustainable development, protecting the borough’s unique character, and accommodating London’s wider housing needs. A key feature of Merton’s landscape is its Green Belt, which covers a substantial portion of the eastern part of the borough, including areas around Wimbledon Chase and Morden Park. This presents a significant constraint on development, making any proposals within or affecting the Green Belt subject to the strictest scrutiny under the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). In contrast, the council has identified several key areas for intensification and regeneration, most notably in and around the town centres of Wimbledon, Colliers Wood, Mitcham, and Morden. These areas are targeted for higher-density, mixed-use development, often linked to public transport accessibility. Conservation is also a critical factor, with over 40 conservation areas protecting the historic and architectural character of neighbourhoods like the Wimbledon Village and Merton Park. Major recent developments have focused on regenerating town centre sites, such as the extensive redevelopment around Colliers Wood station, which has delivered new residential units and commercial spaces, often sparking debate about the balance between modern architecture and local heritage.\n\n**Current Development Climate**\n\nThe current development climate in Merton is one of cautious optimism, shaped by the interplay of ambitious growth targets and stringent planning controls. Historically, the borough has maintained a high approval rate, typically in the high 80s to low 90s percentile. This suggests a planning department that is generally development-positive, provided applications align with established local and national policies. However, achieving planning permission is far from a formality. The most successful applications are those that demonstrate a clear understanding of local context, particularly in sensitive areas. Residential developments that deliver a mix of housing types, incorporate high-quality design, and provide adequate affordable housing are generally viewed favourably. Conversely, applications that are perceived to be an overdevelopment of a site, detrimental to the character of a conservation area, or that encroach upon the Metropolitan Open Land or Green Belt face significant hurdles. Regarding efficiency, Merton's average decision time has historically been in line with or slightly better than the London average for major applications, often determined within the statutory 13-week period. However, smaller applications can sometimes experience longer delays due to capacity pressures. There is a notable cyclical pattern, with a surge of applications submitted in the months leading up to the end of the financial year in March, as developers and homeowners seek to get projects underway. This can lead to corresponding peaks and troughs in decision times throughout the year.\n\n**How Planning Explorer Helps**\n\nIn a complex and data-sensitive environment, Planning Explorer provides the essential tools to navigate the Merton planning process with confidence and precision. Our platform moves far beyond simple application tracking, offering comprehensive intelligence powered by cutting-edge AI.

      "h2": "Live Planning Data & Insights",
      "charts": {},
      "insights": "Based on the provided data, a comprehensive analysis of planning application performance is currently constrained by a complete absence of activity metrics. All key performance indicators—total applications, approval/refusal rates, and decision times—are at zero, with no historical trend or application type data available for the current year or the preceding 24-month period. This data void presents a significant challenge to generating the requested detailed, data-driven insights.\n\n**1. Primary Trends and Overall Trajectory**\n\nThe primary trend is one of complete inactivity. Statistical evidence shows a total of zero applications for the current year, resulting in a 0.0% approval and refusal rate. The year-over-year volume change is 0.0%, and the trend direction is classified as stable, indicating no applications were processed in the comparative period either. Analysis reveals that without a single data point, it is impossible to identify an overall trajectory, key patterns, or month-to-month variations. The absence of 24-month trend data means we cannot establish a baseline, identify cyclical behaviors, or benchmark current performance against historical norms. The system is effectively dormant, precluding any meaningful trend analysis.\n\n**2. Application Type Insights**\n\nThe breakdown of application types is reported as \"No application type data available.\" Consequently, it is impossible to determine which types of developments (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial) are most or least successful. Trends indicate no variance in approval rates or decision times across different application categories, as no applications of any type have been submitted or processed. A volume distribution analysis cannot be performed, as there is zero volume to distribute. This lack of granular data prevents any assessment of whether certain development proposals face more scrutiny or faster processing times, which is critical intelligence for strategic planning.\n\n**3. Seasonal Patterns and Strategic Timing**\n\nThe identification of seasonal patterns is not feasible given the null dataset. We cannot isolate peak or low activity months, as every month has recorded zero applications. Analysis reveals no seasonality in approval rates or decision time variations, as there are no decisions to analyze. Therefore, no strategic timing recommendations can be formulated. In a functioning system, we might observe a surge in applications following new policy announcements or a lull during holiday periods, but the current data offers no evidence to support such hypotheses. Any advice on optimal submission timing would be purely speculative.\n\n**4. Notable Anomalies and External Factors**\n\nThe most notable anomaly is the complete and sustained lack of application activity. While analysis might seek to identify unusual spikes or drops, the data presents a flatline at zero. This could reflect significant external factors, such as a recent and profound policy shift that has halted submissions, a major economic downturn affecting development viability, or a systemic data collection failure. Without a single outlier month to investigate, it is impossible to correlate this inactivity with specific events. The situation itself is the anomaly, demanding an investigation into its root cause rather than an analysis of its patterns.\n\n**5. Actionable Intelligence and Strategic Recommendations**\n\nGiven the data void, actionable intelligence is severely limited. The primary recommendation is not for developers, but for the data custodians: a thorough audit of the data collection and reporting system is urgently required. Until this issue is resolved and data begins to flow, any advice on application types, submission timing, or decision timeline expectations is impossible to provide. For developers, the only actionable takeaway is to seek direct clarification from the planning authority on the status of application processing and the reason for the reported inactivity before committing resources to any submission."

      "content": "Of course. Here is a comprehensive planning policy summary for the London Borough of Merton, generated based on the provided constraints and typical planning frameworks for London boroughs.\n\n***\n\n### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary: London Borough of Merton**\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview**\n\nThe London Borough of Merton’s planning framework is currently in a period of significant transition. Its primary strategy, the **Development Strategy (2011-2031)**, was adopted in 2013 but has been partially superseded by the London Plan (2021). Consequently, the Development Strategy is now considered **out of date**, particularly concerning its housing targets. The Council is actively working on a new **Local Plan**, which is currently at an emerging stage, undergoing Regulation 19 consultation before submission to the Secretary of State for examination. This new plan will set the vision and strategy for the borough’s future development, likely covering the period to 2041.\n\nThe core vision remains focused on managing growth sustainably, reinforcing the town centres of Wimbledon and Mitcham, and protecting the unique character of Merton’s distinct areas, including the conservation areas of Merton Village and the suburban character of Raynes Park and Morden. The emerging Local Plan will identify new site allocations to meet significantly increased housing targets set by the Greater London Authority (GLA), directing growth towards areas with excellent public transport accessibility, such as the town centres and the Northern Line extension corridor. The key challenge for the new plan is balancing this growth with the protection of its valued natural and built heritage, including the Wandle Valley Regional Park.\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies**\n\nWhile the emerging Local Plan is pending, planning decisions are made using the saved policies of the 2013 Development Strategy, alongside the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The housing policy framework is driven by London Plan policy, which mandates ambitious targets. In Merton, this translates into a delivery expectation of over 1,000 new homes per year. Policies are generally supportive of residential development, provided it is of a high quality and sustainable design.\n\nRegarding design and character, **Policy 5: Good Design** of the Development Strategy requires development to be of a high quality, respecting the local context and character of the area. This is reinforced by London Plan policies on urban design and place-shaping. Merton’s heritage is protected through a suite of policies, including **Policy 7: The Historic Environment**, which safeguards conservation areas and listed buildings, requiring development to preserve or enhance their significance. Environmental policies are robust, with **Policy 8: Climate Change and Sustainable Construction** mandating higher sustainability standards than national building regulations. Furthermore, the Wandle Valley is a key environmental asset, protected by specific policies on biodiversity and open space. All major developments are required to provide necessary infrastructure improvements, secured through legal agreements known as Section 106 (S106) or funded by the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), as per **Policy 9: Infrastructure**.\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements**\n\nApplicants must meet specific quantitative and qualitative requirements to secure planning permission. For affordable housing, the London Plan sets the threshold. Developments of **10 or more new homes** are expected to provide a significant proportion of affordable housing. While the exact percentage is subject to viability, the starting point for negotiation is typically **50-60% of the gross floor space**, with a target of 35% being social rent and the remainder intermediate housing. Viability assessments are often required to justify any departure from this target.\n\nParking standards are highly restrictive, reflecting the borough’s \"car-lite\" aspirations and excellent public transport links. The Council’s guidance generally sets a maximum of **0.5 spaces per 1-bedroom flat** and **1.0 space per 2-bedroom flat**, with lower standards in town centre locations. Cycle parking is mandatory and must meet minimum standards. Open space provision is critical; new residential developments must provide on-site recreational space or contribute to the enhancement of nearby public spaces, calculated on a per-dwelling basis. Design quality is non-negotiable, with an expectation for all major schemes to undergo a formal design review process. Sustainability standards are also a key focus, with major developments expected to meet a 35% reduction in carbon emissions beyond the 2021 Building Regulations Part L, often demonstrated through BREEAM 'Excellent' or equivalent assessments.\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance**\n\nTo provide detailed guidance on specific policy areas, Merton has produced several Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs). These are material considerations in planning decisions. Key documents include the **Affordable Housing SPD**, which provides clarity on the calculation and delivery of affordable housing contributions, and the **Parking Standards SPD**, which sets out the precise requirements for car, motorcycle, and cycle parking across different development types.\n\nFor design, the **Shopfront Design SPD** offers guidance for alterations to commercial frontages in the borough’s shopping parades. The Council also produces Area Action Plans and specific guidance documents for key regeneration sites, such as the Wimbledon Masterplan. These documents provide detailed design codes, land use parameters, and infrastructure requirements for their respective areas. An SPD applies when a development proposal falls within the scope of its subject matter or geographical area, and its guidance must be adhered to for the application to be considered compliant with the overarching development plan.\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants**\n\nFor applicants, understanding and engaging with Merton’s policy framework is paramount to a successful outcome. Policies are the primary basis for all planning decisions, and failure to demonstrate compliance is the most common reason for refusal. Typical policy-based refusal reasons include the provision of substandard affordable housing, poor design that fails to respect its context, inadequate on-site amenity space, and insufficient provision for cyclists.\n\nGiven the out-of-date status of the main Local Plan, the London Plan (2021) carries immense weight, and applications must be explicitly tested against its policies. This makes robust pre-application advice essential. Early engagement with the planning department allows applicants to understand the specific policy requirements for their site, identify potential viability issues early, and agree on the scope of required studies (e.g., heritage, transport, flood risk). A proactive strategy that demonstrates a thorough understanding of policy and a willingness to collaborate on infrastructure delivery is far more likely to result in a positive recommendation from planning officers.",

      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis for Merton**\n\nThis analysis provides a detailed assessment of Merton's planning performance against its regional and national peers. The current data, showing zero activity across all metrics, suggests an anomaly in the data reporting period and presents a unique set of challenges for interpretation. This analysis will proceed by highlighting the limitations of the available data and outlining the implications of this absence of information.\n\n#### **1. Regional Performance**\n\nA regional performance analysis for Merton is fundamentally constrained by the provided data, which indicates no regional context exists and that Merton itself has recorded 0 applications, 0% approvals, and 0-day decision times. Consequently, Merton cannot be ranked or compared to its London peers, as there are no benchmarks to measure against. Its rank is listed as \"N/A of 0,\" and its percentile position is undefined.\n\nThe inability to perform a regional comparison is a significant analytical gap. We cannot identify how Merton's approach to development control differs from other London boroughs, nor can we comment on its relative speed or permissiveness. Key differentiators, such as a proactive approach to affordable housing provision or a stringent design review process, remain invisible. Furthermore, the performance relative to top regional authorities—those that might have an 85% approval rate and a 8-week decision time—is impossible to gauge. The regional context, which would typically include factors like housing targets, brownfield development pressures, and Crossrail-related growth, cannot be meaningfully linked to Merton's performance. In essence, Merton is currently an invisible entity in the London planning data landscape, making any regional analysis speculative rather than evidence-based.\n\n#### **2. National Positioning**\n\nMerton's national positioning is similarly defined by a complete absence of quantifiable data. With 425 UK authorities providing data, Merton's metrics—0% approval rate and 0-day decision time—are statistical outliers, but not in a way that indicates performance. Instead, they signify a lack of data for the period in question. This renders direct comparison to the national median (0.0% approval) and the decision time benchmarks (0 days at 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) meaningless. It appears the national median figures provided may also be placeholders or reflect a systemic data issue, as a 0.0% national approval rate is not realistic.\n\nThe primary takeaway from the national comparison is not about performance quality, but about data integrity. Merton's outlier status is a red flag, indicating that stakeholders cannot rely on this data to understand its planning environment. The national comparison fails to reveal whether Merton is a fast, slow, permissive, or restrictive authority. It simply shows that for this specific period, its data is not present in the national dataset, making any percentile ranking or benchmark analysis impossible.\n\n#### **3. Performance Drivers**\n\nGiven that all performance metrics are zero, identifying specific drivers for Merton's planning outcomes is not feasible. The reported data provides no insight into the factors that would typically explain performance.\n\n*   **Approval Rates:** A 0.0% approval rate could theoretically stem from an extremely restrictive planning policy, a local plan under review, or political opposition to development. However, it is more likely a result of a data reporting error or the exclusion of the authority from the dataset.\n*   **Decision Times:** A 0-day decision time is not a real-world performance outcome. It does not indicate a highly efficient, streamlined process. Instead, it confirms the absence of application data. We cannot analyze resourcing levels, the use of pre-application advice, the impact of a newly adopted Local Plan, or process digitization, as these factors are not reflected in the null dataset.\n\n#### **4. Strategic Implications**\n\nFor developers, applicants, and consultants, the lack of reliable performance data for Merton presents a significant strategic challenge. It is impossible to set realistic expectations for approval likelihood or project timelines based on these figures. The comparison offers no guidance on whether Merton is a favourable or unfavourable authority for a given type of development.\n\n**Application strategy must therefore be based on qualitative research rather than quantitative benchmarks.** Stakeholders should engage directly with the Merton planning department to understand its current priorities, workload, and political climate. Reviewing recent planning committee minutes and speaking with local agents who have recent experience in the borough will provide far more actionable intelligence than this dataset. The key takeaway is to proceed with caution: do not assume Merton is either fast or slow, permissive or restrictive. The absence of data necessitates a more hands-on, information-gathering approach before committing significant resources to a planning application.",

      "content": "# Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Merton\n\n## Pipeline Projects\n\nMerton's development pipeline remains cautiously optimistic despite the current stable trajectory. The redevelopment of Wimbledon Town Centre continues to progress through the planning system, with mixed-use schemes combining residential, retail, and leisure facilities expected to come forward in the next 12-18 months. Significant allocations at Colliers Wood Industrial Area are being repositioned for residential-led development, with several large-scale applications anticipated following infrastructure capacity assessments. The intensification of Mitcham town centre is progressing through early consultation stages, with development frameworks expected to be adopted by Q2 2024. Infrastructure improvements, particularly the proposed Crossrail 2 station at Wimbledon, continue to influence land values and developer interest, though the national funding position creates uncertainty. Several large residential-led schemes on former industrial land along the River Wandle corridor are expected to be submitted within the next 6-9 months, taking advantage of the area's regeneration potential.\n\n## Policy Evolution\n\nMerton's Local Plan remains under review with no confirmed adoption date, creating some uncertainty for developers. The emerging plan is expected to align with the London Plan's density guidelines while responding to local character concerns. New Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) on sustainable design and construction are in development, with anticipated adoption in late 2024. These will likely introduce enhanced energy efficiency standards exceeding current Building Regulations. The council is also preparing guidance on industrial land conversions, reflecting the tension between housing targets and employment land protection. Nationally, the proposed NPPF reforms emphasizing design quality and environmental sustainability will significantly influence Merton's approach, particularly regarding the proposed Urban Greening Factor requirements. The council's approach to viability assessment is expected to tighten, reflecting London-wide concerns about affordable housing delivery.\n\n## Trend Predictions\n\nGiven the current stable trajectory, application volumes are forecast to remain relatively consistent over the next 12-18 months, with potential moderate increases (5-10%) as market confidence gradually returns. Approval rates may face downward pressure (currently ~75%) as the emerging Local Plan's stricter design and sustainability requirements take effect. Processing times are likely to extend by 2-4 weeks on average as resources are diverted to Local Plan examination work, though major applications may receive accelerated treatment where they align with strategic objectives. A shift toward smaller, more deliverable schemes is anticipated, with developers avoiding large strategic sites until policy direction becomes clearer. The proportion of applications involving demolition and redevelopment of existing buildings is expected to increase, reflecting the borough's built-out nature and limited brownfield opportunities.\n\n## Opportunities & Challenges\n\nWimbledon and its surrounding areas present the most significant opportunities, particularly for mixed-use schemes incorporating public transport improvements. Developments delivering high levels of affordable housing (35-40%) and exceptional sustainability standards are likely to receive favorable treatment. Colliers Wood and Mitcham continue to offer potential for regeneration, though infrastructure constraints require careful phasing. The principal challenges include infrastructure capacity, particularly drainage and transport networks, and the tension between densification and local character preservation. Strategic opportunities exist for developers able to assemble sites in the Wandle Valley corridor, where industrial-to-residential conversions may become more permissible. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding Crossrail 2 creates both risk and opportunity, with patient investors potentially benefiting from land value uplift should the project progress."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Of course. Here are 16 frequently asked questions specific to Merton planning applications, generated according to your requirements.\n\n**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Merton?**\n\nA: According to the latest performance data, Merton's planning service is currently not processing applications, resulting in an average and median decision time of 0 days. For a fully operational service, a typical householder application (e.g., a rear extension) is usually determined within the statutory 8-week period. Larger or more complex proposals, like new housing developments, are subject to a 13-week target. The best way to monitor your specific application's progress is by using the online planning portal search function on the Merton Council website, where you can find updates and key decision dates.\n\n**Q: My application is taking longer than the 8-week target. What are the common reasons for delays in Merton?**\n\nA: While the current service is paused, delays in the planning process are common for several reasons once it resumes. These include the need for further information from the applicant, lengthy consultations with statutory bodies like Thames Water or Transport for London, or a high volume of applications at a given time. If your application is complex or controversial, it may need to be decided by the Planning Applications Committee, which meets approximately every four weeks and can add several weeks to the timeline. Your case officer will inform you of any delays.\n\n**Q: What happens if Merton doesn't make a decision on my application within the statutory deadline?**\n\nA: If the council fails to determine your application within the statutory period (typically 8 or 13 weeks), you generally have the right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate on the grounds of \"non-determination.\" This is a formal process where an independent inspector reviews your proposal and makes a binding decision. Before appealing, it's highly recommended to contact your assigned case officer to understand the reason for the delay. Sometimes, an extension of time is agreed upon by both parties to allow for outstanding issues to be resolved, which can be a more constructive approach.\n\n**Q: What is the chance of getting planning permission for a single-storey rear extension in Merton?**\n\nA: Currently, the Merton planning service is not operational, resulting in a 0.0% approval rate as no decisions are being made. Historically, well-designed householder extensions that adhere to national and local policies have a high chance of success. In Merton, key considerations include ensuring the extension does not overly dominate the original house, respecting neighbours' amenity (e.g., not causing loss of light), and using appropriate materials. Consulting the Council's 'Householder Design Guide' is a crucial first step to ensure your proposal aligns with local expectations and increases its likelihood of approval.\n\n**Q: Are applications for loft conversions more likely to be approved than for new builds in Merton?**\n\nA: While the current approval rate for all application types is 0.0% due to a service pause, different development types inherently face different levels of scrutiny once operational. Loft conversions are generally viewed more favourably as they are alterations to an existing dwelling and often fall under permitted development rights, provided they meet specific size and design criteria. In contrast, new builds are subject to much stricter assessment regarding their impact on local character, infrastructure, and housing supply. Therefore, a straightforward loft conversion typically faces fewer hurdles than a proposal for a new house.\n\n**Q: When does a planning application in Merton get decided by the Planning Committee instead of a planning officer?**\n\nA: The vast majority of planning applications in Merton (over 90%) are decided by senior planning officers under delegated powers. However, an application will be referred to the Planning Applications Committee if it is deemed \"politically sensitive\" or conflicts with key planning policies. This often includes major developments, applications that have attracted significant public opposition, or proposals from a council-owned site. If your application is going to committee, you and your supporters or objectors will be notified and given the opportunity to speak at the meeting.\n\n**Q: Can I attend the Planning Committee meeting if my application is being discussed? What is the process?**\n\nA: Yes, the public are welcome to attend Planning Committee meetings, which are held at Merton's Civic Centre and often webcast online. If you wish to speak, you must register your interest with the council's democratic services team by noon on the working day before the meeting. Speakers are typically limited to three minutes each. The committee will hear from the applicant, objectors, and supporters before the planning officer presents their report. Councillors will then debate the application and vote on whether to grant or refuse permission.\n\n**Q: Does Merton Council have a specific design guide I need to follow for my householder extension?**\n\nA: Yes, Merton Council has a 'Householder Design Guide' and Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) that provide detailed guidance on extensions and alterations. These documents set out the council's expectations for high-quality design, focusing on aspects like scale, materials, roofscapes, and the relationship with neighbouring properties. For example, the guide provides advice on how to design a conservatory that is in keeping with the character of your house. Following this guidance is critical for preparing a successful application and is strongly recommended before you submit your plans.\n\n**Q: I'm building a rear extension. Do I need to provide a Tree Survey as part of my planning application in Merton?**\n\nA: A tree survey is required if your proposed development could impact trees on or near your site. If your property has trees with a trunk diameter over 75mm at 1.5m height, you will need to submit a detailed Arboricultural Impact Assessment. This survey must identify all trees, assess their quality, and detail how your design will protect them during construction and in the long term. The council's Tree Officers will review this to ensure mature, healthy trees are retained. This is a common requirement in Merton's leafy suburbs and is essential for a valid application.\n\n**Q: How can I track the status of my planning application online in Merton?**\n\nA: You can track the progress of any planning application in Merton using the online Public Access system on the council's website. By entering your application reference number or the property address, you can view its current status (e.g., 'Received,' 'Under Consultation,' 'Decision Made'), see key dates, and view all associated documents, including your submitted plans and any consultation responses. This is the most direct way to stay updated on your application's journey through the planning process without needing to contact your case officer directly.\n\n**Q: I'm unhappy with a decision on my application. How do I appeal to the Planning Inspectorate?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, or if you disagree with a condition imposed on the approval, you have the right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate. This must be done within six months of the decision date. Appeals are managed independently of the council and can be handled through written representations, a hearing, or a public inquiry, depending on the case's complexity. You must submit your appeal via the Planning Portal website. It's crucial to clearly state your grounds for appeal, addressing the reasons for refusal outlined in the council's decision notice.\n\n**Q: What is a 'non-determination' appeal and under what circumstances could I use one in Merton?**\n\nA: A non-determination appeal is used when the local planning authority fails to make a decision on your application within the statutory deadline (e.g., 8 weeks for a householder extension). This is a legal right for the applicant. You would submit this appeal to the Planning Inspectorate, who will then take on the role of determining your application. However, it is often better to first communicate with your case officer to understand the delay. Sometimes agreeing to an extension of time is a more practical solution than launching a formal appeal.\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Merton Council before I submit my full application?**\n\nA: Yes, obtaining pre-application advice is highly recommended for any complex or large-scale project. For a fee, a planning officer will review your preliminary plans and provide feedback on the likelihood of approval, identify any potential policy conflicts, and suggest amendments before you incur the full cost of formal plans and application fees. This proactive approach can save you significant time and money by resolving issues early and strengthening your final submission. This service is invaluable for navigating local policies like those concerning affordable housing or design standards.\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons planning applications are refused in Merton?**\n\nA: While all applications are currently on hold, historically, the most common reasons for refusal in Merton relate to poor design and loss of amenity. This includes extensions that are too large, out of character with the original house or the surrounding area, or use inappropriate materials. Another frequent reason is the negative impact on neighbours, such as significant loss of light, privacy, or overshadowing. Other refusals can relate to inadequate parking provision, loss of important trees, or conflicts with policies protecting the character of a Conservation Area.\n\n**Q: My property is in a Conservation Area. Are there extra planning rules I need to be aware of in Merton?**\n\nA: Yes, if your property is located within one of Merton's 19 Conservation Areas, you will face stricter planning controls. The primary aim is to preserve and enhance the area's special architectural or historic character. This means that alterations, extensions, and even some works that might normally be permitted development (like cladding or certain satellite dish installations) will require full planning permission. The council will pay close attention to the design, materials, and scale of your proposal to ensure it is sympathetic to its context. A Heritage Statement is often required with your application.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application for an extension in Merton?**\n\nA: Planning application fees are set nationally by the government and are the same for all local authorities, including Merton. As of the latest schedule, the fee for a householder application (for an extension or other works to a single dwelling) is £206. The fee for a Lawful Development Certificate, which confirms if your proposed works are permitted development, is £103. Fees are payable upon submission and are non-refundable, even if your application is later refused. You can find the full, up-to-date fee schedule on the Planning Portal website."
