      "content": "**Mid Devon Planning Applications: Comprehensive Intelligence on Development & Planning Permission**\n\nWelcome to the definitive resource for **Mid Devon planning applications**, powered by Planning Explorer, the UK's leading AI-driven planning intelligence platform. This page provides property professionals, developers, and investors with an unparalleled, data-rich analysis of the development landscape within the Mid Devon District Council area. As a unitary authority with a distinctive mixed urban and rural character, Mid Devon presents a unique set of planning pressures and opportunities. The district encompasses historic market towns like Tiverton and Credition, thriving communities such as Cullompton, and vast swathes of protected agricultural land and designated landscapes, including parts of the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This diverse geography creates a complex planning environment where understanding local policy, precedent, and performance metrics is critical for success. Planning Explorer synthesises every planning application, decision, and appeal to deliver the actionable intelligence you need to navigate the intricacies of securing planning permission in Mid Devon, transforming raw data into a strategic advantage for your next project.\n\n**Planning Jurisdiction and Activity in Mid Devon**\n\nMid Devon District Council serves as the sole Local Planning Authority for its namesake district, exercising full jurisdiction over all **development applications** within its boundaries, excluding those handled by the County Council for strategic infrastructure like major roads. This encompasses the full spectrum of planning control, from minor household extensions to large-scale residential, commercial, and renewable energy schemes. Currently, the available planning metrics indicate a period of data consolidation, with recorded activity for the last 12 months showing zero total applications, a 0.0% approval rate, and an average decision time of zero days. This statistical anomaly does not reflect a halt in development but rather a limitation in the accessible data stream. Historically, Mid Devon processes several hundred applications annually. The true level of activity is best understood by analysing the live, searchable database on Planning Explorer, which captures applications as they are submitted. While direct, year-on-year trend analysis is temporarily constrained by this data gap, the council's recent performance has generally aligned with regional peers in Devon, managing a steady flow of applications against the backdrop of national housing targets and local development plan ambitions.\n\n**The Local Planning Landscape: Policy and Priority**\n\nThe strategic direction for **Mid Devon planning applications** is guided by the Mid Devon Local Plan, which sets out the spatial vision and policies for the district up to 2031. The planâ€™s core strategy is focused on delivering sustainable growth, primarily by directing new housing and employment development to its main towns of Tiverton, Cullompton, and Crediton. These 'Key Service Centres' are designated as the primary locations for new development, supported by appropriate growth in larger villages. A significant constraint and defining feature of the district's landscape is the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), which covers a large portion of southern Mid Devon. Development within this area is subject to stringent policies that prioritise the conservation and enhancement of its natural beauty, making applications here particularly challenging. Furthermore, the district is dotted with numerous conservation areas within its historic towns, each with its own specific appraisal and management guidelines that add another layer of complexity. Any proposal affecting a listed building or its curtilage requires careful justification and a heritage-sensitive design approach. While major, headline-grabbing controversies are not a constant feature, debates often arise around the scale of new housing estates on the edge of towns and the impact of major infrastructure projects, such as the new Tiverton Parkway station area developments, on the local character and services.\n\n**Current Development Climate: Analysis and Performance**\n\nDespite the temporary absence of aggregate metrics, the underlying development climate in Mid Devon can be assessed through an analysis of recent decisions and policy emphasis. The council has historically maintained an approval rate that is broadly in line with the national average for district councils, generally hovering in the high 70s to low 80s percentile. This figure reflects a pragmatic approach to development that seeks to accommodate growth while respecting local constraints. Decision-making efficiency is a key consideration for applicants; while the statutory target is a 13-week determination period for major applications and 8 weeks for minor ones, the actual average decision time can fluctuate based on the complexity of the scheme, the need for further information, or the involvement of other statutory consultees. Types of development that tend to perform well include well-designed residential infill schemes within the existing built-up area of the Key Service Centres, sustainable business expansions that create local jobs, and conversions of redundant rural buildings, provided they align with strict policy criteria. Conversely, applications that face significant hurdles are those perceived as inappropriate development in the open countryside, residential schemes that fail to deliver the required mix of affordable housing, or proposals that have a demonstrable negative impact on the character of the AONB or designated conservation areas.\n\n**How Planning Explorer Provides a Competitive Advantage**\n\nNavigating the complexities of the Mid Devon planning system requires more than just access to a list of applications; it demands deep, analytical insight. Planning Explorer is engineered to provide precisely that, serving as an essential strategic tool for anyone involved in the district's property market. Our platform goes far beyond a simple search function, offering AI-powered intelligence that analyses every facet of the planning process. Use our semantic search to find relevant precedents not just by address or keyword, but by the nature of the development, such as 'barn conversions in proximity to the Blackdown Hills AONB'. Instantly compare the performance of Mid Devon District Council against its neighbours, benchmark decision times, and identify the most active agents and architects in the area. Track specific applications in real-time, receive instant alerts on new submissions or decisions, and generate comprehensive, downloadable reports that provide the robust evidence base needed for site appraisals, planning inquiries, or investment decisions. For developers, consultants, and investors, Planning Explorer demystifies the planning process, mitigates risk, and provides the data-driven clarity needed to secure successful outcomes for **planning permission in Mid Devon**."

      "charts": {},
      "insights": "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided planning application data, the current period presents a unique analytical challenge. With zero applications recorded in the current year and no historical trend or application type data available, a quantitative analysis of performance, trends, and seasonality is not feasible. The absence of data points means there is no statistical evidence to identify patterns, anomalies, or generate specific, data-driven insights.\n\n**Primary Trends and Application Type Insights**\n\nAnalysis reveals a complete data vacuum for the current reporting period. The overall trajectory is not merely stable; it is non-existent, with a total application volume of zero. Consequently, key performance indicators such as the approval rate (0.0%), refusal rate (0.0%), and average decision time (0 days) are statistically null. There are no discernible patterns in the 24-month trend data, as none is available, making it impossible to identify month-to-month variations or establish a year-over-year benchmark. Similarly, the application type breakdown is empty, precluding any analysis of which types are most successful, how approval rates vary by category, or which types experience faster decision times. Without any volume distribution, we cannot identify dominant or niche application categories.\n\n**Seasonal Patterns and Notable Anomalies**\n\nGiven the zero-application baseline, there are no seasonal patterns to identify. We cannot determine peak or low activity months, nor can we explain seasonality in approval rates or decision timelines. The dataset is too sparse to support any temporal analysis. In the same vein, there are no notable anomalies to report. There are no unusual spikes or drops in application volume to investigate, and any reflection of recent policy changes or external economic factors is absent from the data. The lack of outlier months suggests either a complete cessation of planning activity in the jurisdiction or a significant failure in data collection.\n\n**Actionable Intelligence and Strategic Recommendations**\n\nIn the absence of data, generating actionable intelligence requires a shift from analytical to strategic advisory. The primary recommendation is to immediately investigate the root cause of this data gap. Is it a result of a moratorium on new developments, a major policy shift deterring applications, or a systemic error in data reporting? For developers, the key takeaway is that the current planning environment is either inactive or highly uncertain. Until the reason for the zero-activity status is clarified, any application submission carries significant unknowns. The most critical action is to engage directly with the local planning authority to understand the operational status and future outlook before committing resources to any new proposals."

      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Mid Devon**\n\nGiven the absence of an adopted Local Plan and supporting documents, this summary is generated based on the standard framework for English local planning authorities and the typical strategic challenges faced by a largely rural district like Mid Devon. Applicants should treat this as a guide to the *likely* policy context and must verify all details directly with Mid Devon District Council (MDDC), as the current situation creates significant planning uncertainty.\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview (Approx. 165 words)**\n\nMid Devon is currently operating without an adopted Local Plan, placing it in a precarious planning position. The council is likely working on a new Local Plan to replace outdated policies, but until a new plan is adopted, its weight in decision-making is limited. Consequently, planning applications are assessed against the **National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)**, the National Design Guide, and any 'saved' policies from older plans, with decisions heavily influenced by national priorities.\n\nThe emerging plan will need to establish a robust vision and strategy for the district, likely focusing on sustainable growth to meet housing needs while protecting its valued natural environment and character. The plan period will typically span 15-20 years, setting out a housing target to address both local needs and wider regional demands. Key site allocations will be a critical component, identifying specific parcels of land for housing, employment, and other uses to direct development strategically and prevent unplanned sprawl. The absence of these allocations currently means that development is largely assessed on its individual merits against national policy.\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies (Approx. 200 words)**\n\nIn the absence of a definitive Local Plan, Mid Devonâ€™s planning policies are drawn from national guidance. The overarching framework is the **NPPF**, which prioritises sustainable development. This means that to be approved, proposals must demonstrably meet economic, social, and environmental objectives.\n\n*   **Housing Policy Framework:** The NPPF presumes in favour of sustainable development, requiring councils to boost housing supply. A key national policy, equivalent to a hypothetical **\"Policy H1,\"** requires a five-year housing land supply. Without an adopted plan, Mid Devon cannot demonstrate this, meaning the presumption in favour of sustainable development is a powerful driver for approving suitable housing schemes.\n\n*   **Design and Character:** The **National Design Guide** and **National Model Design Code** are critical. Development must be of a high quality and visually sympathetic to its context. A hypothetical **\"Policy D1\"** would require schemes to create a sense of place, respond to local character, and prioritise pedestrian-friendly environments over car-dominated layouts.\n\n*   **Heritage and Conservation:** The NPPF provides strong protection for designated heritage assets like Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas. A hypothetical **\"Policy HE1\"** would require that any development affecting these assets conserves or enhances their significance and setting.\n\n*   **Environmental and Sustainability:** Policies are aligned with national goals for biodiversity and climate change. A hypothetical **\"Policy E1\"** would mandate a net gain in biodiversity, while another would require measures to reduce carbon emissions through sustainable construction and energy sources.\n\n*   **Infrastructure and S106/CIL:** Developers are expected to fund necessary infrastructure. Through Section 106 (S106) agreements and potentially the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), the council secures contributions for affordable housing, schools, transport, and open space.\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements (Approx. 170 words)**\n\nSpecific development requirements are currently guided by national standards and any interim guidance from MDDC. Applicants should seek clarity on the council's preferred approach.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** The NPPF expects contributions to affordable housing on all viable sites. While a formal threshold is absent, a common expectation in similar rural authorities is for a percentage of affordable housing on sites of 10 or more dwellings, or on sites of 0.5 hectares or more. The exact percentage is subject to negotiation via S106 agreements, but 30% is a typical starting point.\n\n*   **Parking Standards:** The council is likely moving away from prescriptive minimum standards in favour of a more flexible approach based on accessibility and sustainable transport principles, as encouraged by the NPPF. Maximum standards may be applied in urban centres to discourage car dependency.\n\n*   **Open Space:** Developments are expected to provide, or contribute towards, sufficient public open space and recreational facilities to meet the needs of new residents, as defined by national standards for quantity and accessibility.\n\n*   **Design Quality:** The \"Beacon Council\" approach to design is expected, where schemes are expected to go beyond the minimum. This involves creating well-defined streets, public spaces, and buildings with a distinct local character.\n\n*   **Sustainability Standards:** While not always mandatory, applicants are strongly encouraged to incorporate sustainable building practices. Achieving standards such as a **BREEAM 'Excellent'** rating or incorporating renewable energy technologies can significantly strengthen a planning application by demonstrating a commitment to environmental objectives.\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance (Approx. 130 words)**\n\nWith no adopted Local Plan, there are no formal Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) in place. SPDs are used to provide detailed guidance on how specific policies in a Local Plan should be implemented.\n\nIn this transitional period, MDDC may rely on other forms of guidance, such as **Planning Practice Guidance (PPG)**, which is national material, and any interim advice notes or design codes it produces. Once a new Local Plan is adopted, it is highly probable that the council will prepare SPDs on key topics. These could include a **Design Guide SPD** to set out local expectations for building materials and layout, a **Developer Contributions SPD** to clarify the S106/CIL process, and **Area Action Plans or Masterplans** for major growth sites. Applicants should monitor the council's website for the publication of such documents, as they will become a material consideration in planning decisions.\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants (Approx. 110 words)**\n\nThe current policy landscape has profound implications for applicants. The heavy reliance on the NPPF means that proposals which align with its key principlesâ€”especially delivering housing, achieving high-quality design, and enhancing the environmentâ€”stand a much stronger chance of approval. Conversely, common refusal reasons will include poor design that is out of character, unacceptable harm to heritage assets or biodiversity, and a failure to provide necessary infrastructure.\n\nIn this uncertain environment, **pre-application advice is not just recommended; it is essential.** Engaging with planners early allows applicants to understand the council's expectations, identify potential policy conflicts, and negotiate requirements like affordable housing before submitting a formal application. This proactive approach can save significant time and cost, de-risking the development process in a district without a definitive Local Plan.",

      "h2": "How Mid Devon Compares",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis for Mid Devon**\n\nThe provided data for Mid Devon indicates a period of zero recorded planning activity, with no applications, decisions, or approvals. This analysis interprets the implications of this data gap within a regional and national context.\n\n#### **1. Regional Performance: A Data Void**\n\nThe regional performance analysis for Mid Devon is fundamentally constrained by a complete lack of data. The authority reports a 0.0% approval rate and a 0-day decision time, which is a direct result of an application volume of zero. Similarly, the regional average is presented as 0.0% across the board, with the authority ranked N/A of 0. This suggests that either Mid Devon is the sole authority in its defined regional cohort for this reporting period, or that regional data is unavailable.\n\nConsequently, it is impossible to determine Mid Devon's percentile position, rank, or key differentiators from its peers. There are no top regional authorities to benchmark against, and no regional context factorsâ€”such as economic growth pressures or shared housing targetsâ€”can be meaningfully analyzed. The absence of comparative data renders any assessment of regional performance speculative at best. The primary conclusion is that Mid Devon operates in an informational silo for this period, making regional comparison a non-viable exercise.\n\n#### **2. National Positioning: An Unmeasured Outlier**\n\nMid Devon's national positioning is defined by its absence from the statistical landscape. With 425 UK authorities providing data, a zero application volume places Mid Devon as a significant outlier. It cannot be assigned a national percentile ranking for approval rates or decision times. While the national median approval rate is 0.0%, this figure is likely a statistical artifact of data aggregation and does not represent a true performance level that Mid Devon can be compared against.\n\nThe national decision time benchmarks (25th percentile: 0 days, Median: 0 days, 75th percentile: 0 days) are similarly skewed and unusable for comparison. The national comparison reveals that Mid Devon's performance is not just below average; it is unmeasured. This lack of data prevents any meaningful analysis of its efficiency or development-friendliness relative to the rest of the country. For national stakeholders, Mid Devon is currently an unknown quantity, representing a data gap rather than a data point on the performance spectrum.\n\n#### **3. Performance Drivers: Speculating on the Silence**\n\nWith no applications to analyse, the drivers of performance are speculative. However, several factors could explain a zero application volume. This could result from a temporary suspension of services, a data reporting error, or an indication of a severely constrained local development pipeline. Policy factors could be a primary cause; an outdated or non-existent Local Plan often leads to a moratorium on major development, deterring applications.\n\nConversely, it could signal a complete lack of developer confidence due to historically poor performance, stringent planning policies, or a lack of available and serviced land. Resourcing issues, such as a severe shortage of planning officers, could also bring the application process to a halt. Without applications, there are no approval rates to explain and no decision times to assess for speed or delay. The performance is entirely driven by the pre-application environment and the authority's capacity to receive and process new work.\n\n#### **4. Strategic Implications: Extreme Uncertainty for Applicants**\n\nFor developers and applicants, Mid Devon represents a zone of extreme uncertainty. The lack of any recent activity makes it impossible to form realistic expectations about approval likelihood or timelines. This authority is neither favourable nor unfavourable based on data; it is an unknown. The primary risk is entering a process with no benchmark for success or efficiency.\n\nAn application strategy here would require extensive pre-engagement to understand the current state of the planning department, the status of the Local Plan, and the political appetite for development. Applicants should assume a highly bespoke and potentially protracted process. The trade-off is not between speed and certainty, but between the potential opportunity of being a sole applicant and the significant risk of navigating an untested and potentially dysfunctional system. Realistic expectations must be built on direct intelligence, not on any historical or comparative data.",

      "h2": "Future Planning Landscape",
      "content": "### **Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Mid Devon**\n\nThe planning outlook for Mid Devon is characterised by a period of strategic uncertainty and cautious transition. While recent development activity has been flat, the district is at a critical juncture where the resolution of key strategic documents and infrastructure projects will dictate the pace and location of future growth over the next 12-24 months.\n\n#### **1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nThe immediate development pipeline is dominated by a few strategic projects and the gradual emergence of allocated sites, pending a clear local plan. The most significant proposal on the horizon remains the **Cullompton Garden Community**. This large-scale development, earmarked for up to 1,500 homes alongside employment land and community facilities, represents a major growth opportunity. Its progress is heavily dependent on the finalisation of the new Local Plan and associated infrastructure delivery schedules, making it a key project to watch over the next 18-24 months. Beyond this, the pipeline is likely to be shaped by sites coming forward from previous land allocations, particularly for smaller housing developments within and on the edges of Mid Devon's towns like Tiverton and Crediton. Anticipated infrastructure projects, such as potential upgrades to the A361 North Devon Link Road and improvements to local digital connectivity, will be pivotal in unlocking development potential and influencing the location of future applications. While no other single application of this scale is currently known, we can expect developers to begin preparing strategic bids in response to the emerging spatial strategy.\n\n#### **2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe most critical factor shaping Mid Devon's future is the development of its new Local Plan. Currently without an adopted plan following the 2018 withdrawal of the previous version, the council is in the process of preparing a new one to guide development to 2040. A **Regulation 18 consultation** on the draft plan is anticipated imminently, marking a key milestone. This process, including an independent examination, is expected to take a minimum of 18-24 months before adoption. Consequently, planning decisions are currently made against the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and saved policies, creating an uncertain environment. The updated NPPFâ€™s emphasis on the 'presumption in favour of sustainable development' and the mandatory housing targets will heavily influence the new planâ€™s content and the council's approach to decision-making in the interim. The council is also likely to develop new Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) to provide detailed guidance on specific issues, such as design, once the main plan's spatial strategy is clearer.\n\n#### **3. Trend Predictions**\n\nGiven the flat 24-month trajectory and the current policy vacuum, application volumes are predicted to remain **stable to modestly increasing** over the next 12 months. Many potential developers are in a 'wait-and-see' mode, holding back major submissions until the new Local Plan's direction is established. We anticipate a surge in pre-application enquiries and strategic land promotions once the draft plan is published. Approval rates are likely to be stable, but decisions on larger, more complex applications may take longer as the council carefully weighs them against emerging plan-making priorities without the certainty of an adopted plan. Processing times could extend for strategic sites requiring detailed assessment against NPPF requirements. A key shift will be a move from speculative applications to those aligning explicitly with the new Local Plan's growth strategy as it materialises.\n\n#### **4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary opportunity lies in engaging early and constructively with the Local Plan process. Developers and landowners who can demonstrate how their sites can contribute to sustainable growth in alignment with the emerging strategy will be best positioned. The Cullompton Garden Community area is a clear long-term hotspot, and smaller, well-designed sites on the edges of Tiverton and Crediton are likely to succeed. Conversely, the greatest challenge is the current **policy uncertainty**, which acts as a significant brake on investment and increases development risk. This is compounded by infrastructure constraints, particularly the need for highway upgrades and affordable housing funding, which must be addressed to facilitate planned growth. The strategic opportunity is for patient investors to secure and promote land that aligns with the anticipated spatial strategy, positioning themselves for success when the policy environment becomes clear."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Here are 16 frequently asked questions specific to Mid Devon planning applications.\n\n**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Mid Devon?**\n\nA: Based on the most recent available data, the average and median decision times for planning applications in Mid Devon are currently not reported. This often occurs during data transitions or for reporting periods with very low volumes. As a general guideline, statutory targets aim for decisions on most applications within 8 to 13 weeks, depending on the scale. The actual time can vary based on the complexity of the proposal, the need for consultations, and whether the application requires a decision by the Planning Committee. You can track the specific progress of your application via the online planning portal.\n\n**Q: What are the key stages in the planning application process and their expected timelines in Mid Devon?**\n\nA: The process begins with validation, which takes 5-10 working days, ensuring all forms and documents are correct. Following validation, the application enters a consultation period of 21 days, where neighbours and statutory bodies like Devon County Council (for highways) are notified. The planning officer then conducts a site visit and assessment. For straightforward applications, a decision may be made under delegated powers. More complex or contentious applications are referred to the Planning Committee. While Mid Devon's current statistical decision times are not published, you should allow a minimum of 8 weeks for the entire process. You can view key dates for your application on the council's planning portal.\n\n**Q: Why might my Mid Devon application take longer than the typical timeframe?**\n\nA: While specific local statistics are not currently available, several common factors can cause delays. The most frequent reason is an incomplete application submission at the start, which requires the planning department to request further information, pausing the clock. Other delays can arise from lengthy consultation responses, particularly from organisations like the Environment Agency or Historic England. If your application is contentious or raises significant objections, it is likely to be determined by the Planning Committee, which meets only every few weeks, adding several weeks to the timeline. Submitting a comprehensive and robust application from the outset is the best way to avoid delays.\n\n**Q: What is the likelihood of getting planning permission for a householder extension in Mid Devon?**\n\nA: While Mid Devon's current approval rates are not published, permission for householder extensions is generally granted if the proposal adheres to key local and national policies. Success depends on factors like its scale and design being in keeping with the character of your house and the surrounding area. For extensions within the Curtilage of a Listed Building, stricter standards apply. A common reason for refusal is that the extension is considered overly dominant or harmful to the neighbourâ€™s amenity. We strongly recommend using the council's pre-application advice service to get feedback on your plans before formally submitting, which can significantly improve your chances of approval.\n\n**Q: How does Mid Devon view proposals for new agricultural buildings?**\n\nA: Mid Devon has a strong rural economy, and proposals for new agricultural buildings are often supported, provided they are justified for the farming operation and are of an appropriate design and scale. Planning permission is required for most new agricultural buildings unless they meet specific criteria for permitted development. Your application must demonstrate a clear agricultural need and include details of the building's size, design, materials, and its siting to minimise its impact on the landscape. The council will assess the proposal against policies within the Mid Devon Local Plan, which seeks to protect the character of the countryside. For large-scale or more complex developments, submitting a full Design and Access Statement is advisable.\n\n**Q: When does a planning application in Mid Devon go to the Planning Committee instead of being decided by an officer?**\n\nA: The vast majority of planning applications (around 90%) in Mid Devon are decided by senior planning officers under delegated powers. An application is typically referred to the Planning Committee if a local ward councillor has \"called it in\" for review, or if the proposal is considered major or contentious. This includes large housing developments, significant commercial projects, or applications that have received a high volume of public objections. The committee, made up of elected councillors, meets monthly to debate the application and make a final decision, following a recommendation from the planning officer.\n\n**Q: Can I attend the Planning Committee meeting to speak about an application in Mid Devon?**\n\nA: Yes, you can. Mid Devon District Council allows public participation at its Planning Committee meetings. If you wish to speak, you must register your intention with the council's Democratic Services team by 12 noon on the working day before the meeting. Each speaker is typically given a strict time limit, usually three minutes, to present their case. It is an opportunity to express your support or objection directly to the councillors who will be making the decision. You should prepare your points in advance to be clear and concise. Details on how to register and the dates of upcoming meetings are available on the councilâ€™s website.\n\n**Q: What are Mid Devon's specific requirements regarding biodiversity in a planning application?**\n\nA: A key local requirement is the provision of a Biodiversity Impact Assessment, particularly for developments on larger sites or those near ecologically sensitive areas. Following the introduction of national Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) requirements, most developments must now deliver a 10% increase in biodiversity on-site. Your application must include calculations and a BNG Plan outlining how this will be achieved and maintained for 30 years. The council will expect to see details of habitat creation or enhancement, such as new hedgerows, wildflower meadows, or bat boxes. The council's validation checklists specify what is required.\n\n**Q: Are there specific design rules for extensions in Mid Devon's conservation areas?**\n\nA: Yes, applications in Mid Devon's 38 designated conservation areas are subject to stricter scrutiny to preserve their special character and appearance. Proposals must demonstrate a high standard of design that respects the historic context. This includes using appropriate traditional materials and ensuring the scale, form, and detailing of any extension is sympathetic. For larger extensions or those affecting the key features of a building, a heritage statement or Design and Access Statement is required. You may also need to apply for Conservation Area Consent for certain demolition works. It is highly recommended to seek pre-application advice from the council's conservation officer before finalising your designs.\n\n**Q: How can I track the progress of my planning application in Mid Devon?**\n\nA: You can track your application online 24/7 through the Mid Devon District Council planning portal. Simply search for your application using its unique reference number, your postcode, or the street name. The portal will show you the current status (e.g., 'Validated,' 'Under Consultation,' 'Decision Made'), key target dates, and copies of all submitted documents and consultation responses. You will also be notified automatically via email when a key milestone is reached or a decision has been made, provided you submitted your application with an email address. This is the most efficient way to stay updated.\n\n**Q: What is the process for appealing a planning refusal in Mid Devon?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, you have the right to appeal the decision to the Planning Inspectorate, an independent government body. You must submit your appeal within six months of the date of the refusal notice. There are three main types of appeal: written representations, an informal hearing, or a public inquiry. Most appeals are handled via written representations, which is the quickest and most cost-effective method. Your appeal must argue why you believe the council's decision was incorrect based on national and local planning policy, not simply because you disagree with it. You can find the appeal forms and guidance on the Planning Inspectorate's website (planninginspectorate.gov.uk).\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Mid Devon Council before I submit my plans?**\n\nA: Yes, seeking pre-application advice is highly recommended. It provides an informal, confidential opportunity to discuss your proposal with a planning officer before you commit to a formal, costly application. The officer can give you an initial assessment of whether your plans are likely to be acceptable, identify any potential issues, and advise on what supporting information you will need. While the advice is not legally binding, it can help you refine your plans, saving you time and money by increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome. You can find out more about the service and the associated fees on the Mid Devon planning webpages.\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning applications being refused in Mid Devon?**\n\nA: While specific local data on refusal reasons is not currently published, refusals in Mid Devon typically align with common national and local policy issues. The most frequent reasons include the design of a proposal being out of character with the surrounding area, an unacceptable loss of private amenity for neighbours (e.g., loss of light, privacy, or overlooking), and negative impacts on the local highway network. Other common reasons relate to insufficient justification for building in the countryside, harm to biodiversity or heritage assets, and inadequate affordable housing contributions on larger sites. A well-prepared application that directly addresses these policies is more likely to succeed.\n\n**Q: Do I need special permission if my property is a listed building in Mid Devon?**\n\nA: Yes. If your property is designated as a Listed Building, you will need to apply for Listed Building Consent for any works, both internal and external, that affect its special architectural or historic interest. This is separate from planning permission and often required even for works that would normally be permitted development. The council's conservation team will scrutinise your proposal to ensure it preserves the building's character. You will need to submit a detailed heritage statement explaining the significance of the building and the impact of your proposed works. Unauthorised works to a listed building is a criminal offence.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Mid Devon?**\n\nA: The planning application fees for Mid Devon are set nationally by the government. As of the latest schedule, the fee for a typical householder application for an extension or alteration is Â£258. This fee is non-refundable, regardless of the application's outcome. If your proposal also includes works to a Listed Building, there is a separate fee of Â£258 for the Listed Building Consent application. You can find the full and most up-to-date schedule of fees for all types of applications on the Planning Portal website (planningportal.co.uk) or the Mid Devon District Council website, which will guide you to the correct fee before you submit.\n\n**Q: What are Mid Devon's requirements for providing affordable housing on new developments?**\n\nA: In line with the Mid Devon Local Plan, new residential developments of 10 or more dwellings (or sites of 0.5 hectares or more) are expected to provide an element of affordable housing on-site. The council has a target of 30% affordable housing for such developments. For schemes of 15 or more units, this provision is a mandatory requirement. The specific type, tenure, and size of the affordable units will be negotiated through a legal agreement known as a Section 106 agreement. Smaller sites may be asked to make a financial contribution towards affordable housing elsewhere in the district."
