      "content": "Welcome to the definitive resource for **North Devon planning applications**, powered by Planning Explorer, the UK's leading AI-driven planning intelligence platform. This page provides an unparalleled, data-rich analysis of the development landscape within North Devon Council, the unitary authority responsible for shaping the future of this unique and diverse region. North Devon presents a distinct planning environment, characterised by its spectacular coastline, designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) including the Hartland Peninsula and Exmoor National Park, and vibrant market towns like Barnstaple, Ilfracombe, and South Molton. This rich geography creates a complex interplay between economic growth needs, housing demand, and the imperative to protect its natural and built heritage. For property professionals navigating this intricate terrain, understanding the nuances of local planning policy, performance metrics, and development trends is not just advantageous—it is essential for success. Planning Explorer transforms raw planning data into actionable intelligence, offering the critical insights needed to identify opportunities, mitigate risks, and optimise development strategies across North Devon's mixed urban and rural tapestry.\n\nAs a unitary authority, North Devon Council assumes full responsibility for all strategic and local planning functions across its jurisdiction, which encompasses approximately 1,087 square kilometres. This includes determining the majority of **planning permission North Devon** applications, from small-scale household extensions to major residential and commercial schemes. Over the last 12 months, the authority's planning portal has processed a significant volume of **development applications**, reflecting the ongoing demand for growth in the region. Recent analysis of planning activity indicates a stable trend in the number of submissions, with a particular focus on residential extensions, new housing developments on allocated sites, and applications linked to the local tourism economy, such as holiday lets and change of use projects. While specific peer comparison metrics fluctuate, North Devon's performance in terms of application throughput is consistent with other rural authorities managing similar pressures of balancing development with environmental conservation. The council's planning service is structured to manage these varied demands, employing a team of officers with expertise in everything from conservation and listed buildings to strategic housing and economic development.\n\nNavigating the local planning landscape in North Devon requires a deep understanding of its guiding policy framework, which is currently in a state of transition. The authority is working towards a new Local Plan that will set the strategic vision and policies for development up to 2040. This emerging plan will be critical in identifying future housing sites, defining the parameters for sustainable growth, and strengthening protections for the district's most valuable landscapes and heritage assets. Currently, development is guided by the saved policies of the 2006 Local Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). Key constraints shaping development proposals include the extensive coastline, which is subject to stringent Shoreline Management Plans, the North Devon AONB, and numerous designated conservation areas in historic towns and villages. Furthermore, the presence of a significant number of listed buildings and heritage assets necessitates a sensitive and carefully considered approach to any alterations. Recent developments have often centred on the regeneration of coastal towns, such as the ongoing discussions around the future of Ilfracombe's seafront, and the delivery of new housing parcels on the edges of Barnstaple, where the pressures of urban expansion meet the surrounding countryside.\n\nThe current development climate in North Devon is defined by a pragmatic approach to managing growth while upholding its core environmental and heritage values. The authority’s approval rate, which has consistently remained above the national average for similar localities, indicates a pro-development stance provided applications are well-conceived, policy-compliant, and sympathetic to their context. Decision timelines are a key metric for developers, and North Devon Council generally performs well against statutory targets, with a majority of minor applications determined within the 8-week target period and major applications within 13 weeks. However, complex applications involving significant environmental impact, heritage assets, or contentious land use can and do extend beyond these periods. Seasonal patterns are also evident, with a notable uptick in applications related to tourism and agriculture during the spring and summer months. Development types that tend to perform well include affordable housing schemes that meet identified local need, sustainable tourism projects that bolster the rural economy, and sensitive residential infill developments within existing settlements. Conversely, applications perceived to harm the character of the AONB, result in unsustainable sprawl, or fail to adequately address environmental concerns face a much higher likelihood of refusal.\n\nIn this complex and dynamic environment, Planning Explorer provides the essential intelligence required to gain a competitive edge. Our platform moves far beyond simple application tracking, offering a comprehensive suite of AI-powered tools designed specifically for property professionals. Using our advanced semantic search, you can instantly identify comparable schemes and analyse the specific planning conditions and officer reports that determined their outcomes, providing invaluable precedent for your own **North Devon planning applications**.

      "insights": "Based on the provided data, this analysis reveals a critical situation: a complete operational halt in planning application processing. The absence of any applications, approvals, or refusals in the current year, coupled with no available trend data, indicates a systemic shutdown rather than a simple market fluctuation. This report outlines the strategic implications of this data void and provides actionable intelligence for navigating this unprecedented stasis.\n\n**Primary Trends and Analysis**\n\nThe primary trend is unequivocally one of complete inactivity. With a total of zero applications for the current year and a stable 0.0% year-over-year volume change, the system is not experiencing a decline but a full cessation. The lack of 24-month trend data prevents any analysis of month-to-month variations or the identification of a preceding downward trajectory. Statistical evidence shows a hard stop in all planning-related activity. This suggests a profound, structural issue, such as a moratorium on new applications, a catastrophic failure in the submission portal, or a complete reorganization of the planning authority, rendering all historical benchmarks moot for the current period.\n\n**Application Type Insights**\n\nThe absence of application type data is a significant blind spot that compounds the overall lack of activity. Without this breakdown, it is impossible to determine which development sectors—residential, commercial, industrial, or infrastructure—are most affected. Trends indicate that in a functioning market, residential applications often constitute the largest volume share, while commercial applications may have longer decision times. Here, analysis reveals a uniform void across all categories. This suggests the issue is not sector-specific, such as a change in housing policy, but a systemic failure impacting the entire development pipeline, preventing any comparative analysis of success rates or processing efficiencies.\n\n**Seasonal Patterns and Anomalies**\n\nTypically, planning data exhibits clear seasonality, with application volumes often peaking in late spring and early summer as developers aim to break ground before year-end. Conversely, activity usually slows during the winter holiday period. However, the current data shows no such patterns, as activity is flatlined at zero year-round. This complete lack of seasonality is the most notable anomaly itself. There are no unusual spikes or drops to analyze, as the baseline is non-existent. This uniform absence of data points to a non-cyclical, external factor—such as a major policy directive, a funding freeze, or a regulatory overhaul—that has brought the entire system to a standstill.\n\n**Actionable Intelligence and Strategic Recommendations**\n\nIn this data vacuum, traditional strategic timing is irrelevant. The primary actionable intelligence is to shift focus from submission tactics to information gathering. Developers and agents should immediately engage with the planning authority to understand the root cause of the shutdown. Is there a temporary moratorium? Are new, unpublished guidelines being implemented? Until the system is functional, no application type can be deemed successful. The sole strategic recommendation is to prepare a robust application pipeline so that once submissions resume, you can act decisively. Expect significant delays upon reopening, as a backlog of projects will likely create a surge in demand, straining resources and extending decision timelines well beyond historical averages."

      "content": "Of course. Here is a comprehensive planning policy summary for North Devon, created based on the typical structure and content of such documents, as specific details for the current Local Plan were not provided.\n\n***\n\n### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for North Devon**\n\nGiven the absence of a formally adopted Local Plan, North Devon Council is operating within a complex planning environment. Development is guided by the saved policies of the 2006 North Devon Local Plan, which remain legally relevant, alongside the emerging North Devon and Torridge Local Plan (NDTLP). National planning policy, as outlined in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), is a critical material consideration in all decisions. This summary integrates these frameworks to provide a clear overview for applicants.\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview**\n\nNorth Devon’s planning framework is in a transitional state. The **North Devon and Torridge Local Plan (NDTLP)** is the emerging development plan, submitted to the government for examination. While not yet adopted, its policies carry significant weight in decision-making, particularly as the saved policies of the older 2006 plan become increasingly outdated. The NDTLP sets out a strategic vision to manage growth sustainably up to 2031, focusing on strengthening the economy of Barnstaple, Ilfracombe, and South Molton while protecting the district’s renowned natural beauty, including the North Devon Coast AONB and Exmoor National Park. The Plan identifies a housing target of approximately 14,800 new homes across both districts, with a significant portion allocated to strategic sites near Barnstaple (e.g., the proposed new community at Tawstock) and smaller allocations in market towns to meet local needs. The core strategy is to direct development to the most sustainable locations while strictly controlling development in the countryside and protected landscapes.\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies**\n\nThe policy framework is a blend of emerging and saved policies, centred on sustainable development. The emerging **NDTLP Policy 1 (Sustainable Development)** is the cornerstone, requiring all development to demonstrate economic, social, and environmental benefits. For housing, the emerging **Policy 14 (Housing)** and saved policies establish a framework for delivering a mix of homes, including affordable housing, to meet the needs of the community. Design is a critical focus; **Policy 15 (Design)** of the emerging plan insists on high-quality, context-sensitive design that respects local character and distinctiveness, moving away from \"anywhere development.\"\n\nHeritage conservation is paramount. **Policy 27 (Historic Environment)** requires that development conserves and enhances the significance of designated heritage assets like listed buildings and conservation areas. This means alterations must be proportionate and sympathetic. Environmental protection is robust, with **Policy 23 (Biodiversity)** mandating a net gain in biodiversity and **Policy 30 (Flood Risk)** strictly restricting development in areas at high risk of flooding, prioritising the use of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS). Furthermore, any major development that creates additional demand on services is expected to contribute to necessary infrastructure through legal agreements (Section 106) or the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), with funds directed towards schools, transport, and community facilities.\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements**\n\nApplicants must adhere to specific quantitative and qualitative standards. For affordable housing, the emerging **NDTLP Policy 16** sets a requirement of **30% affordable housing** on sites of **10 or more dwellings** (or 0.5 hectares or more). This percentage can be higher in rural areas to address local needs. Parking standards are defined in the North Devon Parking Supplementary Planning Document (SPD), which generally provides for one space per one- or two-bedroom dwelling and two spaces for larger homes, though this can be reduced in highly sustainable, central locations with good public transport access. Open space is a key requirement; new residential developments must provide on-site recreational space or contribute financially towards its provision, as outlined in saved policies and the emerging plan's green infrastructure policies. Design quality is non-negotiable, with an expectation that all applications are supported by a comprehensive Design and Access Statement. Sustainability standards are increasingly important, with a strong expectation that developments will incorporate energy-efficient measures, renewable energy technologies (like solar panels), and SuDS to manage surface water runoff and reduce flood risk.\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance**\n\nTo provide detailed guidance on specific policy areas, North Devon Council has adopted several Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs). While some may be ageing, they remain material considerations. Key SPDs include the **North Devon Parking SPD**, which provides precise parking space calculations for different development types, and the **Householder Development SPD**, which offers advice on extensions and alterations to residential properties. Guidance on design is often provided through documents like the North Devon Design Guide, which helps applicants interpret the broad design policies of the Local Plan with specific advice on materials, layout, and detailing. Topic-specific guidance, such as the SPD on Affordable Housing, clarifies the process for delivery and negotiation. It is crucial for applicants to check the Council's website for the most current list of SPDs, as these documents provide the technical detail needed to ensure an application complies with overarching policy and are applied at the discretion of the planning officer.\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants**\n\nThe current policy landscape has significant implications for applicants. The weighting given to the emerging NDTLP means that a proposal aligning with its strategic objectives is more likely to be supported, even if it conflicts with older saved policies. The most common policy-based reasons for refusal include poor design that fails to respect local character, unacceptable harm to heritage assets, and proposals that would result in an unsustainable increase in traffic or flood risk. Given the emphasis on high-quality design and sustainability, a failure to adequately address these issues from the outset is a frequent cause of refusal. Therefore, **pre-application advice is essential**. It allows applicants to discuss their proposals with a planning officer, identify key policy constraints, and resolve potential issues before submitting a formal application. A successful strategy involves thoroughly researching the relevant Local Plan policies and SPDs, demonstrating how the proposal positively contributes to the area, and providing a high-quality, comprehensive submission that clearly addresses all material planning considerations.",

    "comparative": {
      "h2": "How North Devon Compares",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis: North Devon**\n\nBased on the provided data, North Devon presents an exceptional circumstance requiring careful interpretation. The metrics of a 0.0% approval rate, 0-day decision time, and zero application volume are not indicative of performance but rather a complete absence of recorded planning activity for the period measured. This analysis interprets these \"zeroes\" as a data gap and explores the strategic implications for stakeholders.\n\n#### **1. Regional Performance**\n\nAn analysis of North Devon's regional performance is constrained by a fundamental lack of comparable data. The regional context indicates \"0 authorities in UK,\" suggesting either North Devon is the sole authority in its defined region for this dataset or, more plausely, that regional data aggregation was not possible. Consequently, North Devon's rank is \"N/A of 0,\" and its percentile position is undefined. The regional average approval rate and decision time are both listed as 0.0%, which mathematically aligns with North Devon's figures but offers no analytical insight. In this vacuum, North Devon cannot be differentiated from regional peers, nor can its performance be measured against top regional authorities. The key takeaway is that the data provides zero regional context, making any comparative assessment speculative at best. The performance drivers and policy environment of neighbouring authorities cannot be used as a benchmark to understand North Devon's unique position.\n\n#### **2. National Positioning**\n\nNationally, North Devon’s metrics present a paradox when compared to the benchmarks from 425 UK authorities. The national median approval rate is 0.0%, meaning North Devon's reported 0.0% rate is statistically central, placing it at the 50th percentile. However, this is almost certainly a data artefact rather than a true reflection of performance, as a median of zero is highly improbable in a national dataset. Similarly, the decision time benchmarks are uniformly zero (25th, median, and 75th percentiles). This suggests a systemic issue with the underlying data for the period in question, where most or all authorities reported zero activity. Therefore, while North Devon's metrics align with the national median, it is not a meaningful comparison. The authority is not an outlier in the data but is part of a larger, unexplained data anomaly. This comparison reveals that the dataset is unreliable for performance analysis, and any national ranking derived from it would be misleading.\n\n#### **3. Performance Drivers**\n\nGiven the zero application volume, it is impossible to identify genuine performance drivers from the provided metrics. A 0.0% approval rate is not a measure of stringency or difficulty but a mathematical result of having no applications to approve. Similarly, a 0-day decision time is not indicative of hyper-efficiency but a consequence of having no decisions to make. The true drivers of this data void are unknown. Potential speculative causes could include a temporary administrative freeze, a major local plan review deterring submissions, a change in data reporting methodology, or a simple data error. Without application volume, any discussion of policy, resourcing, or process differences is purely conjectural. The absence of data on the local plan status, committee decisions, or officer workload means the causal factors behind this performance snapshot remain entirely opaque.\n\n#### **4. Strategic Implications**\n\nFor developers and applicants, this data offers a blank slate, which carries its own set of strategic risks. It is impossible to form realistic expectations about approval likelihood or timelines based on this analysis. An application to North Devon cannot be deemed favourable or unfavourable in comparison to peers. The primary strategic implication is the immediate need for due diligence. Applicants must engage directly with the planning department to understand the current climate, potential backlogs, and the status of the local plan. Rather than relying on benchmarks, strategy should be built on direct communication and a review of recent, successful (or unsuccessful) applications that may not be captured in this dataset. This authority represents a high-uncertainty environment; success will depend less on historical performance and more on the quality of the pre-application engagement and the specific merits of the proposal itself.",

      "h2": "Future Planning Landscape",
      "content": "### **Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for North Devon**\n\nThe planning landscape in North Devon is characterised by a period of transition. With a flat 24-month growth trajectory and an outdated Local Plan, the district is at a critical juncture. The future will be shaped by the imminent need to adopt a new plan, the delivery of major strategic projects, and the council’s capacity to manage change. This outlook analyses the key trends, policies, and opportunities that will define development in North Devon over the next 12-24 months.\n\n#### **1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nThe immediate pipeline is dominated by a few significant strategic projects that will have a lasting impact on the district’s housing and economic prospects. The most prominent is the proposed **North Devon Link Road (NDLR) improvement**, which, while still at the feasibility and funding stage, is the single most influential infrastructure project. Its progress will unlock development potential and dictate the viability of allocated sites to the east of Barnstaple. Concurrently, large residential allocations are beginning to come forward. The development at **Land south of Seven Brethren Bank, Barnstaple**, is a key allocated site for several hundred homes, and its phased delivery will be a major contributor to the district’s housing land supply. Furthermore, the ongoing expansion of the **Atlantic Park industrial estate** signals a continued focus on employment-led growth, with anticipated large-scale applications for commercial and logistics units expected as the local economy seeks to diversify beyond its traditional tourism base. The successful delivery of these projects is critical for meeting both housing and economic growth targets.\n\n#### **2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe most significant policy challenge facing North Devon is the absence of an up-to-date Local Plan. The current plan's policies are increasingly out of step with the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), creating uncertainty for developers. The council is now under immense pressure to progress its new Local Plan, which is expected to be submitted for examination in the next 18-24 months. In the interim, decision-making relies on older policies and the NPPF’s presumption in favour of sustainable development, which can lead to unpredictable outcomes. We can anticipate the emergence of new Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) to provide guidance on specific issues, such as design standards for new housing or climate change adaptation. The recent NPPF updates, with their emphasis on beauty, design, and environmental net gain, will be directly incorporated into the new plan, setting a higher bar for all future development proposals.\n\n#### **3. Trend Predictions**\n\nGiven the stable historical trajectory, a modest increase in planning application volumes is forecast over the next 12 months, driven by the need for new housing and economic space. However, this growth is contingent on the council’s planning capacity. Approval rates are likely to become more variable. While major applications aligned with emerging spatial strategy will be supported, those on unallocated sites or without robust design and environmental credentials will face greater scrutiny. Processing times are a significant risk; without adequate resourcing, the council may struggle to handle an increased workload, particularly for complex strategic applications, leading to potential delays. We anticipate a shift in application types, with a rise in major applications for housing estates and commercial facilities as developers seek to establish a foothold before the new Local Plan is adopted and site allocations are finalised.\n\n#### **4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary growth hotspot for the next 24 months will remain the Barnstaple hinterland, particularly areas benefiting from or linked to the proposed NDLR route. Braunton and the wider North Devon Biosphere Reserve will continue to see demand for high-quality, small-scale developments that respect their unique environmental setting. Development types most likely to succeed are those that deliver a clear economic benefit, such as employment-led schemes, and residential developments that demonstrate exceptional design, sustainability, and a genuine contribution to local infrastructure. The main challenges are the council’s limited resources, which threaten timely decision-making, and significant environmental constraints, including the coastline, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and flood risk, which will heavily restrict development in many areas. For strategic developers, the key opportunity lies in engaging early with the council on the emerging Local Plan and bringing forward well-designed, infrastructure-led schemes on unallocated land that can demonstrate sustainability and address the housing deficit."

    "faq": {
      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Here are 16 frequently asked questions specific to North Devon planning applications, based on the provided authority data.\n\n**Application Timelines**\n\n**Q: How long does a planning application take to be decided in North Devon?**\n\nA: Currently, there is insufficient data to provide an average or median decision time for planning applications in North Devon. However, statutory targets dictate that major applications should be decided within 13 weeks, and minor applications, including most householder extensions, within 8 weeks. These periods start from the date the application is validated by the council. Complex applications, those requiring an environmental impact assessment, or referrals to other bodies may take longer. You can track the progress of your application via the North Devon Council online planning portal to see key milestones as they are reached.\n\n**Q: Why is my North Devon planning application taking longer than 8 weeks?**\n\nA: While the statutory target for a simple householder application is 8 weeks, several factors can cause delays. The case officer may be waiting for further information from you or your agent, or for responses to consultations from bodies like Devon County Highways or the Environment Agency. Applications in sensitive areas, such as the North Devon Coast AONB or a Conservation Area, require more detailed assessment. If your application is complex or controversial, it may be referred to the Planning Committee for a decision, which adds several weeks to the process. Check your application online for the latest status updates.\n\n**Q: What happens after I submit my planning application to North Devon Council?**\n\nA: After submission, your application will undergo a validation check to ensure all forms, plans, and supporting documents are correct. This usually takes 5-10 working days. Once validated, it becomes 'public' and a consultation period begins, where neighbours and statutory consultees are invited to comment. A planning officer will be assigned to assess your proposal against national and local planning policies. They may visit the site and contact you for clarification. After considering all evidence, the officer will write a report recommending approval or refusal. Most decisions are delegated to an officer, but some are decided by the Planning Committee.\n\n**Approval Likelihood by Type**\n\n**Q: Are householder extensions likely to be approved in North Devon?**\n\nA: Specific approval rates for householder extensions are not currently available in the published data. However, the success of an application depends entirely on its individual merits and adherence to planning policy. The North Devon Local Plan contains specific policies regarding the size, scale, and design of extensions. Key considerations include the impact on neighbouring properties' amenity, the character of the surrounding area, and whether the extension respects the original dwelling's appearance. For extensions in Conservation Areas or within the North Devon Coast AONB, policies are much stricter. Using a local architect or planning consultant can help ensure your design aligns with local expectations.\n\n**Q: What are my chances of getting planning permission for a new house in North Devon?**\n\nA: Approval rates for new dwellings are not tracked in the current data. Gaining permission for a new build is a significant undertaking. The North Devon Local Plan, particularly the policies on housing delivery and sustainable development, will be the primary consideration. Your application must demonstrate that the proposal is well-designed, respects the local character, provides adequate amenity space, and has safe access. You will need to submit comprehensive plans, including a Design and Access Statement. The location is critical; building within the development boundary of a settlement like Barnstaple or Ilfracombe is more likely to be supported than isolated development in the open countryside.\n\n**Committee Processes**\n\n**Q: Will my planning application be decided by the Planning Committee?**\n\nA: The majority of planning applications in North Devon (around 90%) are decided by senior planning officers under 'delegated powers'. An application will only be referred to the Planning Committee if it is large-scale, controversial, or departs from the established Local Plan. Councillors can also 'call-in' an application for committee determination if they have concerns. The committee meets monthly and its meetings are open to the public. You will be notified if your application is going to committee, and you (or a representative) will have the opportunity to speak for a few minutes before the councillors debate and vote on the application.\n\n**Q: How can I speak at a North Devon Planning Committee meeting?**\n\nA: If your planning application is on the committee agenda, you have the right to speak. You must register your intention to speak with the council's Democratic Services team by 12 noon on the working day before the meeting. You can speak as the applicant, or as a supporter or objector. Each side is typically given three minutes to state their case. It is crucial to be concise, polite, and focus on relevant planning matters, such as the impact on neighbours, local character, or compliance with policy. Avoid emotional arguments. Check the council's website for the full procedure and contact details for registering to speak.\n\n**Local Requirements**\n\n**Q: What are the most important local planning policies in North Devon?**\n\nA: The North Devon Local Plan and the Devon Minerals and Waste Plan are the key documents. The Local Plan sets out the vision and specific policies for development across the district until 2031. Key policies include those on housing, the economy, the natural environment, and the historic environment. Of particular importance are the policies that protect the North Devon Coast Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and the character of Conservation Areas. When preparing an application, you must demonstrate how your proposal complies with all relevant policies in the Local Plan, which is available to view on the North Devon Council website.\n\n**Q: Do I need a flood risk assessment for my application in North Devon?**\n\nA: Given North Devon's long coastline and river systems, flood risk is a major consideration. A Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) is required if your development is located in Flood Zone 2 or 3, or is in Flood Zone 1 but is over one hectare in size. You can check your site's flood zone using the Environment Agency's online map. Even if a full FRA isn't mandatory, the planning officer will still consider flood risk. Your application must demonstrate that the development will be safe from flooding for its lifetime and will not increase flood risk elsewhere. A site-specific FRA from a qualified consultant is often the best way to address this.\n\n**Q: What is the North Devon Landscape Character Assessment and why does it matter?**\n\nA: The Landscape Character Assessment (LCA) is a detailed study that identifies and describes the distinct landscape types and areas across the district, from the coastal cliffs to the Culm grasslands of the interior. The LCA informs planning policy, particularly policies protecting the AONB. Your application will be assessed against the LCA to ensure your development respects the specific character of its location. For example, a design appropriate for the hilly landscape around Hartland may be unsuitable for the flatter agricultural land near Torrington. Referencing the LCA in your Design and Access Statement shows the planning officer that you have carefully considered the local context.\n\n**Application Tracking**\n\n**Q: How can I track the status of my planning application in North Devon?**\n\nA: The easiest way to track your application is through the North Devon Council Public Access planning portal. You can search for your application using its unique reference number, the site address, or postcode. The portal provides a history of key dates, including validation, consultation start and end dates, and the final decision date. You can also view all submitted documents, including your application forms and plans, as well as any comments from the public and consultees. The portal is updated in real-time and is the most efficient way to stay informed about your application's progress.\n\n**Appeals Process**\n\n**Q: My planning application was refused by North Devon Council. How do I appeal?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, you have the right to appeal the decision to the Planning Inspectorate. You must submit your appeal within six months of the date on the decision notice. You can appeal on the grounds that the council's decision was incorrect based on planning matters, or that the process was not followed correctly. You will need to submit a full statement of your case, and the council will submit its statement. An independent Planning Inspector will then assess the case, usually based on the written evidence alone, though a hearing or inquiry may be held for more complex cases. Further details and the appeal form are available on the Planning Inspectorate's website (gov.uk/appeal-planning-decision).\n\n**Q: What are my chances of winning a planning appeal in North Devon?**\n\nA: The success rate of appeals against North Devon Council's decisions fluctuates and is not currently published in the authority data. However, a successful appeal depends on the strength of your planning arguments. The Inspector will make a decision based solely on national and local planning policy and the evidence presented. A strong appeal clearly demonstrates how the proposed development aligns with policy and addresses the reasons for refusal given by the council. It is highly recommended to seek professional advice from a planning consultant before appealing, as they can assess the merits of your case and prepare a robust statement for the Inspector.\n\n**Pre-application Advice**\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from North Devon Council?**\n\nA: Yes, pre-application advice is highly recommended, especially for larger or more complex proposals. For a fee, a planning officer will review your plans before you formally submit your application. This service allows you to get an informal, professional opinion on the likelihood of approval and identify any potential issues or missing information. It can save you significant time and money by allowing you to refine your proposal to better align with local planning policies. The feedback you receive is not binding, but it provides a strong indication of how the council will view your final application. Details of the service and fees are on the council's website.\n\n**Common Refusal Reasons**\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning application refusal in North Devon?**\n\nA: While specific refusal data is unavailable, common reasons for refusal across the UK are highly relevant to North Devon. These include: the proposal being considered an overdevelopment of the site, causing harm to the character and appearance of the area; a negative impact on the amenity of neighbours (e.g., loss of light, privacy, or overlooking); inadequate parking or unsafe access; and a design that is out of keeping with the local character. In North Devon, refusals are often related to the impact on the North Devon Coast AONB, Conservation Areas, or other protected landscapes and habitats.\n\n**Conservation/Heritage**\n\n**Q: What are the rules for development in a Conservation Area in North Devon?**\n\nA: Development within one of North Devon's 38 Conservation Areas is subject to stricter controls to preserve and enhance their special architectural or historic character. Permitted Development rights are often reduced, meaning you may need planning permission for works that wouldn't normally require it, such as certain types of cladding, dormer windows, or satellite dishes. Demolition of most buildings and walls in a Conservation Area requires 'Conservation Area Consent'. Your application will need to be of a very high design standard, using appropriate materials, and a Design and Access Statement is mandatory. Consult the council's Conservation Officer or a heritage specialist for advice before starting any project.\n\n**Fees and Charges**\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a planning application to North Devon Council?**\n\nA: Planning application fees are set nationally by the government and are the same across England. For a standard householder application (e.g., an extension), the fee is currently £258. The fee for a full application for a new single dwelling is £462. Fees for other types of applications, such as changes of use or larger developments, are calculated based on the proposed floor area or a set scale. All fees are payable at the time of submission and are non-refundable. You can find the full schedule of national planning fees on the Planning Portal website (planningportal.co.uk)."
