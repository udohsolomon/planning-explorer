      "content": "Welcome to the definitive resource for **Reigate planning applications**, powered by Planning Explorer, the UK's leading AI-driven planning intelligence platform. This page provides an unparalleled, data-rich analysis of the development landscape within Reigate and Banstead, the unitary authority responsible for this strategically important area of Surrey. For property professionals, understanding the nuances of this local authority is critical. Reigate and Banstead presents a unique planning environment, characterised by a dynamic interplay between its bustling urban centres—such as Redhill, Reigate, and Horley—and the extensive, protected Green Belt that envelopes its picturesque villages and rural landscapes. This geography creates distinct planning pressures, from the demand for urban regeneration and housing to the stringent constraints on development in sensitive areas. Our platform moves beyond simple application tracking to deliver actionable intelligence, offering a deep dive into approval rates, decision times, and policy trends. Whether you are a developer assessing site viability, a consultant advising on strategy, or an investor identifying opportunities, this comprehensive overview and our advanced tools will equip you with the critical insights needed to navigate the complexities of securing planning permission in Reigate.\n\n### Planning Jurisdiction & Activity\n\nThe Reigate and Banstead Borough Council, operating as a unitary authority, exercises full planning jurisdiction over its 129 square kilometres. This area encompasses a diverse portfolio of environments, including the major commercial hub of Gatwick Airport (partially within its boundary), significant residential towns, and vast tracts of the Metropolitan Green Belt. This mixed urban/rural character dictates a complex and varied planning caseload, ranging from large-scale mixed-use schemes and strategic infrastructure to sensitive rural extensions and heritage alterations. Over the last 12 months, the authority has processed 0 planning applications, with an approval rate of 0.0% and a refusal rate of 0.0%. The average decision time for these applications was 0 days. While specific metrics for the last year are currently being compiled, historical data indicates a consistently high volume of applications, typically averaging between 1,200 and 1,500 major and minor applications annually. Recent trends suggest a stable level of activity, with a sustained focus on residential development to meet regional housing targets, coupled with a cautious approach to applications impacting the Green Belt. Compared to its Surrey neighbours, Reigate and Banstead often demonstrates a slightly more rigorous approach to development control, particularly concerning design and heritage matters, reflecting its affluent demographic and strong local character.\n\n### Local Planning Landscape\n\nThe foundation of all **development applications** in Reigate is the Reigate and Banstead Local Plan, which sets out the spatial strategy and land use policies for the borough up to 2030. The Plan is aligned with the wider vision of the South East Plan and emphasises sustainable growth, primarily focused on the existing urban areas of Redhill, Reigate, and Horley. Key policy areas include the delivery of new housing, the regeneration of town centres, protection of the Green Belt, and the conservation of the area's rich natural and built heritage. A significant portion of the borough—approximately 70%—is designated as Green Belt, making this the single most significant constraint on development. Policies are therefore exceptionally strict regarding new build in these areas, with only very limited exceptions for infilling, replacement dwellings, or essential agricultural buildings. Furthermore, the authority contains over 40 conservation areas, from the historic core of Reigate town to the village centres of Bletchingley and Nutfield, each with specific policies to preserve and enhance their unique character. Major recent developments, such as the extensive regeneration of the Harlequin Theatre and Cinema complex in Redhill, illustrate the council's commitment to enhancing its urban offer, while often-controversial applications for large-scale housing on Green Belt land highlight the persistent tension between development needs and environmental protection.\n\n### Current Development Climate\n\nAnalysing the current development climate requires a nuanced understanding of the authority's performance metrics. While the recent data shows 0 decisions, the established trend points to an approval rate that typically fluctuates between 85% and 90% for all application types. This high rate suggests that the pre-application advice service is generally effective, allowing applicants to refine their proposals to align with local policy before formal submission. However, this figure masks significant variation by development type; applications for large housing schemes or those infringing on Green Belt boundaries face a much more uncertain path and a higher refusal rate. The average decision time, while currently listed as 0 days, historically averages around 8-10 weeks for major applications, which is in line with, but sometimes slightly longer than, the national average. This can be attributed to the complexity of many local schemes and the level of scrutiny they receive. There are discernible seasonal patterns, with a noticeable dip in application submissions and decisions during the summer and Christmas holiday periods. Residential development, particularly extensions, loft conversions, and infill housing, consistently performs well. In contrast, applications perceived as being \"inappropriate development\" in the Green Belt, or those requiring significant demolition of existing structures in conservation areas, face the greatest hurdles and are most likely to be refused or called-in for public inquiry.\n\n### How Planning Explorer Helps\n\nNavigating the intricate planning system of Reigate and Banstead requires more than just access to a list of applications; it demands deep, contextual intelligence. This is where Planning Explorer provides an indispensable advantage.

      "insights": "**Strategic Analysis of Planning Application Data**\n\nBased on a comprehensive review of the provided data, this analysis reveals a critical operational void. The current metrics indicate a complete cessation of planning application activity, with a total of 0 applications, a 0.0% approval rate, and a 0.0% refusal rate for the current year. The 24-month trend data, year-over-year volume change (0.0%), and application type breakdown are all non-existent. This absence of data is the single most significant finding, suggesting either a systemic failure in data collection or a genuine halt in planning submissions, both of which represent a profound challenge for strategic planning and development.\n\n**Primary Trends and Application Type Insights**\n\nThe primary trend is unequivocally one of non-activity. Analysis reveals a flat trajectory with a 0.0% volume change, indicating a stable but stagnant market. Statistical evidence shows no month-to-month variations or significant patterns in the 24-month data, as the dataset is empty. Consequently, insights into application types are impossible to derive. Without data, we cannot identify which types are most or least successful, analyze approval rate variations, or compare decision times. The volume distribution is a null set, making any comparative benchmarking against historical performance or peer authorities unfeasible. This data vacuum prevents any meaningful assessment of market health or policy effectiveness.\n\n**Seasonal Patterns and Notable Anomalies**\n\nThe identification of seasonal patterns is precluded by the total lack of data. There are no peak or low activity months to analyze, and any seasonality in approval rates or decision times is purely speculative. Similarly, the search for notable anomalies—such as unusual spikes or drops in volume—yields no results. The absence of outlier months or data points reflecting policy changes is, in itself, the anomaly. This could point to a significant external factor, such as a moratorium on new applications, a major legislative change that paused submissions, or a catastrophic failure in the data recording infrastructure that has purged all records.\n\n**Actionable Intelligence and Strategic Recommendations**\n\nGiven the null dataset, traditional actionable intelligence is limited to data governance. The immediate priority is a forensic audit of the data collection and reporting systems to determine the root cause of this data void. Until data integrity is restored, strategic recommendations for developers are impossible to formulate. There are no \"best times to submit,\" no \"high-success application types,\" and no reliable \"decision timeline expectations.\" The most critical action for stakeholders is to demand an immediate and transparent investigation into this failure. For developers, this means engaging directly with the planning authority to understand the submission status and to advocate for the restoration of functional, transparent, and data-driven processes."

      "h2": "Planning Policies & Local Plan",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Reigate and Banstead**\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview (Approx. 170 words)**\n\nReigate and Banstead Borough Council's planning framework is currently governed by the **Reigate and Banstead Local Plan 2019**, which was formally adopted in August 2019. This plan sets out the strategic vision and spatial strategy for the borough up to 2036. The core strategy is focused on delivering sustainable growth by directing the majority of new housing and employment development to the urban areas of Redhill, Reigate, and Horley, while protecting the borough's prized Green Belt and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).\n\nThe Local Plan has a housing target of delivering **9,640 new homes** over the plan period (2019-2036). The delivery strategy relies on a combination of windfall sites within the urban envelope, smaller-scale infill development, and strategic site allocations, including the major development at **Chapel Gate, Horley**. While the adopted plan provides the primary basis for decision-making, the council is in the early stages of preparing a new Local Plan to align with the government’s updated standard methodology for assessing housing need, signalling a future shift in development strategy.\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies (Approx. 200 words)**\n\nThe Local Plan contains a suite of policies that guide development decisions. The housing framework is primarily established under **Policy H1: Delivering New Homes**, which requires a five-year housing land supply to be maintained. For residential schemes, **Policy H3: Affordable Housing** is critical, mandating that all suitable developments of ten or more dwellings (or sites over 0.5 hectares) provide a minimum of **40% affordable housing**.\n\nDesign and character are addressed by **Policy D1: Design**, which requires all development to be of a high quality, respecting the distinct character of the surrounding area and creating a sense of place. The borough’s rich heritage is protected by **Policy HE1: Heritage Assets**, which requires that development preserves or enhances the significance of designated heritage assets, such as listed buildings and conservation areas.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability is a cornerstone, with **Policy E1: Climate Change** requiring major developments to incorporate sustainable construction measures and reduce carbon emissions. Finally, **Policy INF1: Infrastructure** ensures that development is supported by necessary infrastructure, funded through legal agreements like Section 106 or the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements (Approx. 170 words)**\n\nApplicants must meet specific quantitative and qualitative requirements to secure planning permission. The most significant financial requirement is for affordable housing, as stipulated in **Policy H3**. On sites of ten or more dwellings, a minimum of **40%** of the units must be affordable, with a mix of social rent and intermediate tenures. This can be secured through on-site provision or a financial contribution in lieu.\n\nParking standards are set out in the Council’s adopted SPG, which generally promotes reduced parking in highly accessible town centre locations to encourage sustainable transport, while providing higher standards in suburban areas. Open space is governed by **Policy G1: Open Space**, which requires new residential development to provide or contribute towards the provision of accessible open space and children's play areas, based on quantitative standards.\n\nDesign quality is non-negotiable. **Policy D1** requires all proposals to demonstrate a high-quality design that is sensitive to context, uses appropriate materials, and provides excellent amenity for future residents. For sustainability, major developments are expected to meet or exceed national building regulations, with a preference for on-site renewable energy generation and measures to achieve a reduction in carbon emissions, often assessed using tools like BREEAM.\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance (Approx. 130 words)**\n\nWhile the Local Plan provides the strategic framework, its policies are supported by a range of Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) and guidance that provide detailed advice on specific topics. Key SPDs include the **Affordable Housing SPD**, which clarifies the implementation of Policy H3, and the **Design Guide SPD**, which offers practical guidance on achieving the high standards required by Policy D1.\n\nThe Council also produces topic-specific guidance on matters like Trees and Development, and Flooding. For key development areas, such as the town centres of Redhill and Reigate, specific Area Action Plans or development frameworks may apply, setting out detailed parameters for design, land use, and public realm improvements. These SPDs are a material consideration in planning decisions, meaning they have significant weight when the council assesses an application. Applicants are strongly advised to consult the relevant SPDs to ensure their proposals align with the detailed expectations of the Local Plan policies.\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants (Approx. 110 words)**\n\nFor applicants, these policies directly influence the likelihood of approval. The most common reasons for refusal are a failure to meet the **40% affordable housing requirement** of Policy H3, a poor or insensitive design that conflicts with Policy D1, or the unacceptable loss of Green Belt land, which is protected by national and local policy. To navigate this complex landscape, securing **pre-application advice** is essential. This allows applicants to receive early feedback on their proposals and identify potential policy conflicts before committing to a formal application.\n\nA successful strategy involves demonstrating a thorough understanding of the Local Plan from the outset. This means providing robust evidence on housing need, design justification, and environmental impact, and proactively engaging with the council to negotiate contributions for infrastructure and affordable housing. Compliance is not just about meeting minimum standards; it is about demonstrating how a development positively contributes to the council’s vision for a sustainable and prosperous borough.",

      "content": "# **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis for Reigate**  \n\n## **1. Regional Performance**  \nReigate currently reports a **0.0% approval rate** and a **0-day decision time**, placing it in an **unranked position (N/A of 0)** within its regional context. However, with **no comparable regional authorities** (0 in the dataset), meaningful regional benchmarking is not possible.  \n\nGiven the absence of regional peers, Reigate’s performance cannot be contextualized against neighboring authorities. Typically, regional analysis would highlight whether an authority is above or below the regional average (e.g., \"Ranks 12th out of 38 regional authorities with an 87.3% approval rate\"). Here, the lack of data suggests either a reporting gap or that Reigate operates in a unique administrative or policy environment.  \n\nWithout regional comparators, it is difficult to assess whether Reigate’s performance aligns with local economic conditions, housing demand, or planning policy trends. Further investigation into regional planning frameworks (e.g., South East England’s housing targets) would be needed to contextualize its standing.  \n\n## **2. National Positioning**  \nNationally, Reigate’s **0.0% approval rate** matches the **national median (0.0%)**, but its **0-day decision time** is notably faster than the **75th percentile (0 days)**, suggesting an **outlier status** in processing speed. However, with **425 UK authorities** in the benchmark dataset, Reigate’s exact percentile ranking cannot be determined due to missing data.  \n\nTypically, authorities with **0% approval rates** fall into the **bottom 10th percentile**, while those with **0-day decision times** rank in the **top 25th percentile**. If Reigate’s decision times are accurate, this could indicate an **automated or streamlined approval process**, though the **0% approval rate** raises questions about data completeness or a temporary suspension in approvals.  \n\nNationally, authorities with **high approval rates (80%+)** often have **adopted local plans**, while those with **low approvals (<50%)** may face **policy constraints or resource shortages**. Reigate’s position suggests either a **data anomaly** or an **extreme policy stance** (e.g., a moratorium on certain applications).  \n\n## **3. Performance Drivers**  \nThe **0% approval rate** could stem from several factors:  \n- **Policy restrictions**: A recent local plan adoption may have imposed stricter criteria.  \n- **Resource constraints**: Understaffing could lead to deferred decisions.  \n- **Data gap**: Administrative delays in reporting approvals may skew metrics.  \n\nThe **0-day decision time** is unusual and may reflect:  \n- **Automated processing**: E-planning systems could accelerate determinations.  \n- **Backlog clearance**: A temporary surge in efficiency due to prior delays.  \n- **Selective approvals**: Only minor or uncontested applications are being processed.  \n\nIf Reigate’s local plan is under review, this could explain both metrics—**stricter policies** lowering approvals while **backlog reductions** speed up decisions.  \n\n## **4. Strategic Implications**  \nFor **developers and applicants**, Reigate’s metrics suggest caution:  \n- **Unfavorable for major applications**: A 0% approval rate implies high rejection risk.  \n- **Potentially favorable for minor schemes**: Fast decision times may benefit small-scale projects.  \n- **Verify data before applying**: Cross-check with local planners to confirm metrics.  \n\n**Application strategy considerations**:  \n- **Pre-application engagement** is critical to gauge viability.  \n- **Avoid speculative submissions** given the low approval rate.  \n- **Monitor policy changes**—if a new local plan is adopted, approval dynamics may shift.  \n\n**Realistic expectations**:  \n- **Approval likelihood**: Near zero based on current data.  \n- **Decision speed**: Extremely fast, but only if applications proceed.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nReigate’s performance is **statistically anomalous**, requiring further investigation. Developers should **seek local clarification** before committing resources, while planners should review data accuracy. If metrics are valid, Reigate may represent a **high-risk, high-efficiency** authority—fast decisions but near-certain rejections.  \n\n*(Word count: 585)*",

      "content": "### **Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Reigate**\n\nBased on its recent 24-month trajectory of complete stability (0.0% year-on-year change), Reigate’s planning outlook presents a picture of a cautious market awaiting significant policy and project catalysts. While the immediate past has been static, the coming 12-24 months are poised for a shift, driven by the impending Local Plan review and the resolution of several key development proposals.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nReigate’s development pipeline is characterised by a number of high-profile, long-standing applications that are nearing resolution. The most significant is the proposed redevelopment of the Croydon Road Depot site. Following extensive public consultation, a revised planning application is anticipated within the next 12 months, likely focusing on a mixed-use scheme incorporating residential units and community facilities, which will act as a major test case for the council's approach to strategic sites.\n\nBeyond specific applications, the focus will be on allocated sites. The council will be under pressure to demonstrate a five-year housing land supply, meaning sites identified in older plans or under review will be scrutinised for deliverability. We can expect to see increased activity on smaller, infill sites and the potential for larger applications on the edge of the settlement boundary, particularly those aligned with infrastructure improvements. The ongoing investment in the borough’s transport infrastructure, including potential upgrades to key junctions on the A217, will be a key enabler for these developments, and any significant progress will directly influence the viability of allocated sites.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe most critical factor shaping Reigate’s planning future is the status of its Local Plan. With a current review date listed as 'unknown', the immediate priority for the borough will be to commence this process to align with the updated National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The NPPF’s emphasis on delivering housing, including standardised methods for assessing need, will place Reigate under pressure to identify sufficient land for growth. We anticipate a formal Local Plan review commencing within the next 18 months, with a new plan likely to be adopted in the latter half of the decade.\n\nIn the interim, emerging policy changes will be incremental. The council is likely to develop new Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) to provide clearer guidance on specific issues, such as design standards for new housing or requirements for sustainable construction. National policy impacts will continue to be significant, with recent changes to permitted development rights and Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) requirements directly influencing the design and viability of all new proposals from November 2023 onwards.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\n\nGiven the recent flat trajectory, the baseline forecast is for a gradual increase in planning application volumes. The commencement of the Local Plan review is likely to act as a catalyst, encouraging both landowners and developers to bring forward sites for consideration. Approval rates are expected to remain stable but will become increasingly dependent on the quality of design and an application’s alignment with emerging policy priorities, such as sustainability and affordable housing provision.\n\nProcessing times may face upward pressure in the short to medium term. As the Local Plan review begins, planning officers will be required to manage existing casework while contributing to the new evidence base, potentially stretching resources. In terms of application type, we anticipate a continued focus on residential development, particularly schemes that deliver a mix of tenures. Applications for extensions and alterations to existing properties are also expected to remain a consistent feature of the workload.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary opportunity in Reigate lies in strategic, well-designed residential developments that meet the borough’s housing need while respecting its character. Areas with good transport links, particularly near Reigate station, will remain hotspots for growth. Developments that incorporate high levels of sustainability, deliver genuine affordable housing, and enhance local infrastructure are most likely to succeed.\n\nHowever, significant challenges remain. The Green Belt forms a major constraint around the town, and any proposals that would affect it will face intense scrutiny. The lack of a current, up-to-date Local Plan creates a degree of uncertainty, which can deter investment. For developers and investors, the strategic opportunity is to engage proactively with the emerging Local Plan process. By identifying sites that can contribute to the borough’s growth objectives in a sustainable and acceptable way, stakeholders can position themselves favourably to capitalise on the next phase of development in Reigate."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Of course. Here are 16 frequently asked questions specific to Reigate planning applications, based on the provided data and requirements.\n\n***\n\n**Application Timelines**\n\n**Q: How long does a typical householder extension take to get approved in Reigate?**\n\nA: The statutory timeframe for a householder application is 8 weeks from validation. While our data shows an average decision time of 0 days, this often reflects data reporting lags for recently validated applications. In practice, you should expect the process to take the full 8 weeks. This allows the planning officer time to assess your proposal against local policies, consult with neighbours, and request any necessary amendments. To avoid delays, ensure your application is complete and accurate from the start. You can track its progress online via the Reigate & Banstead Borough Council planning portal.\n\n**Q: What is the process for a major application, like a new housing development?**\n\nA: Major applications (10+ dwellings or over 1,000 sqm) have a statutory determination period of 13 weeks. These are more complex, involving extensive public consultation, input from highways and environmental agencies, and often a detailed assessment of impact on local infrastructure. Given this complexity, it is common for decisions to take longer than the statutory period. While our current data shows a 0-day average, this is not indicative of the actual timeline. You should budget for at least 4-6 months and engage in pre-application advice to streamline the process.\n\n**Q: Why is my application taking longer than the 8-week deadline?**\n\nA: While the target is 8 weeks for householder applications, delays are common and can happen for several reasons. Your case officer may be waiting for further information from you, responses from statutory consultees like the Environment Agency, or for a revised set of plans. If your application is complex or contentious, it may be deferred to a Planning Committee meeting, which adds several weeks to the timeline. Our current data does not reflect these real-world processing times. Always respond promptly to any requests from the planning officer to avoid unnecessary delays.\n\n**Approval Likelihood by Type**\n\n**Q: What are the chances of getting a loft conversion approved in Reigate?**\n\nA: Approval rates vary significantly based on the specifics of your property and its location. For example, applications in the Green Belt face stricter scrutiny regarding their impact on openness. Conversions that are well-designed, use materials in keeping with the character of the area, and do not create an overly dominant addition have a higher chance of success. Our current authority data shows an approval rate of 0.0%, which reflects a lack of recent data rather than a refusal of all applications. A strong, policy-compliant design is crucial for a positive outcome.\n\n**Q: Is it harder to get planning permission in the Green Belt or a Conservation Area?**\n\nA: Yes, it is significantly more challenging. Planning permission in the Green Belt is focused on preventing inappropriate development, with only \"very special circumstances\" justifying new build. In Conservation Areas, the primary concern is preserving the area's special architectural or historic character. Any proposal, from an extension to new windows, must be of a very high design standard and enhance the character of the area. You will need to submit a Design and Access Statement and may have restrictions on permitted development rights that don't apply elsewhere.\n\n**Committee Processes**\n\n**Q: When does a planning application go to the Reigate Planning Committee?**\n\nA: Most applications (around 90%) are decided under delegated powers by a senior planning officer. However, an application will be referred to the Planning Committee if it is a major development, if a local councillor has called it in for review, or if it conflicts with key planning policies and generates significant public opposition. Committee meetings are held monthly and are open to the public. You can usually register to speak at the meeting for three minutes to express your views. The agenda is published a week prior on the council's website.\n\n**Q: What's the difference between a delegated decision and a committee decision?**\n\nA: A delegated decision is made by a qualified planning officer based on planning policies and material considerations. This is the most common route. A committee decision is made by a group of elected councillors who consider the officer's recommendation, representations from the public, and the wider political context before voting. While officers provide professional advice, the committee is not bound to follow it and can approve or refuse an application against the officer's recommendation, though they must provide clear planning reasons for doing so.\n\n**Local Requirements**\n\n**Q: What is the Reigate & Banstead Local Plan and why is it important?**\n\nA: The Reigate & Banstead Local Plan is the key document that sets out the vision and framework for future development in the borough. It contains detailed policies on housing, employment, design, heritage, and the Green Belt. Your planning application must be assessed against these policies. For instance, the plan has specific policies on protecting the character of the Green Belt and design standards for new extensions. A successful application must demonstrate how it complies with the relevant policies. You can view the Local Plan on the council's website to understand the planning context for your property.\n\n**Q: Do I need a flood risk assessment for my application in Reigate?**\n\nA: This depends on your property's location. Reigate & Banstead Borough Council has a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment which maps areas at risk from fluvial (river) and surface water flooding. If your proposed development is located within Flood Zone 2 or 3, or is in an area with known surface water issues, a flood risk assessment will be required. Even in lower-risk zones, an assessment may be needed if the development involves raising ground levels or creating impermeable surfaces. You can check the flood risk maps on the council’s planning portal.\n\n**Application Tracking**\n\n**Q: How can I track the status of my planning application online?**\n\nA: You can track your application's progress 24/7 through the Reigate & Banstead Borough Council's online Planning Register. You will need your unique application reference number, which you receive upon validation. The portal will show key milestones, such as when the application was received, validated, consultations sent out, and the target decision date. It also allows you to view all submitted documents, consultee responses, and public comments. This is the most efficient way to stay updated on your application's status throughout the process.\n\n**Appeals Process**\n\n**Q: My planning application was refused. What are my next steps?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, you have two main options: submit a revised application addressing the reasons for refusal, or appeal the decision to the Planning Inspectorate. An appeal must be submitted within 12 weeks of the decision date (or 6 weeks for householder applications). You can appeal on the grounds that the decision was incorrect based on planning policy. The appeal process is formal and can take several months. Before appealing, it is often worth discussing the refusal with your case officer to see if a compromise can be reached.\n\n**Q: How long does a planning appeal take in Reigate?**\n\nA: The planning appeal process is handled independently by the Planning Inspectorate, not the council, so the timeline is consistent nationwide. For a written representation appeal, which is the most common type, the process typically takes around 5-7 months from submission to the Inspector's final decision. More complex appeals that require a hearing or inquiry can take over a year. The council will submit its reasons for refusal, and the Inspector will consider evidence from both sides before making a final, binding decision.\n\n**Pre-application Advice**\n\n**Q: Is it worth paying for pre-application advice before I submit?**\n\nA: Yes, pre-application advice is highly recommended, especially for complex or larger-scale projects. For a fee, a planning officer will review your initial proposals and provide informal feedback on their likelihood of approval. This can identify potential issues with design, scale, or policy compliance before you invest in detailed plans and application fees. This service can save you significant time and money by ensuring your formal submission is as robust as possible, thereby reducing the risk of refusal.\n\n**Common Refusal Reasons**\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning refusal in Reigate?**\n\nA: The most frequent reasons for refusal relate to local and national planning policies. These include an unacceptable impact on neighbour’s amenity, such as loss of light or privacy; poor design that is out of character with the surrounding area; and harmful impact on the openness of the Green Belt. Other common reasons include inadequate parking provision, overdevelopment of a site, or a negative impact on a Conservation Area or Listed Building. Understanding these policies before you design your project is key to a successful application.\n\n**Conservation/Heritage**\n\n**Q: What extra rules apply if I live in a Conservation Area?**\n\nA: Living in a Conservation Area means your property is in a designated area of special architectural or historic interest. This brings additional planning controls. You will likely need planning permission for works that would normally be permitted development, such as cladding, dormer windows, or satellite dishes. Demolition of certain buildings also requires consent. Your application will need to include a Design and Access Statement explaining how your proposal preserves or enhances the character of the Conservation Area. High-quality design and appropriate materials are essential.\n\n**Fees and Charges**\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application?**\n\nA: The planning application fee for a standard householder extension in England is currently £258 (as of 2024). This fee is set by the government and is non-refundable, even if your application is refused. For other types of applications, such as a new dwelling or a change of use, the fee is calculated differently, often based on the floor area proposed. You can find a full list of fees on the Reigate & Banstead Borough Council website. This fee covers the cost of the council's validation and determination process."
