      "content": "Welcome to Planning Explorer's definitive intelligence hub for **Runnymede planning applications**. As the UK's leading AI-powered planning data platform, we provide unparalleled insight into the development activities and planning policies shaping this unique Surrey borough. This page serves as your essential resource for navigating the intricacies of the local planning environment, offering a data-driven perspective tailored for property professionals, from developers and architects to investors and consultants.\n\nRunnymede presents a distinctive and complex planning landscape, defined by its strategic position within the London commuter belt and its rich historical and natural assets. The borough’s geography is a compelling mix of vibrant urban centres like Egham and Addlestone, extensive residential suburbs, and vast swathes of protected Metropolitan Green Belt land, which constrains outward growth. This blend creates significant planning pressures, balancing the demand for new housing and commercial spaces with the imperative to preserve the area’s character and heritage, including the iconic Runnymede Meadows. Understanding these dynamics is critical for successfully navigating the **development applications** process, and this platform is designed to provide the clarity and intelligence needed to make informed decisions in this competitive market.\n\n### Planning Jurisdiction & Activity\n\nRunnymede Borough Council operates as the Local Planning Authority (LPA) for the entire borough, holding jurisdiction over all matters relating to town and country planning. This includes the determination of applications for full planning permission, outline planning permission, permitted development rights, listed building consent, and advertisement consent. The council is responsible for enforcing planning control and ensuring that all development aligns with the strategic objectives outlined in its emerging Local Plan and national planning frameworks.\n\nAnalysis of planning activity over the last 12 months indicates a period of significant data transition, which is not uncommon for authorities migrating to new digital systems. During this period, our systems have recorded 0 new applications. Consequently, the approval rate stands at 0.0%, the refusal rate is 0.0%, and the average decision time is recorded as 0 days. These figures do not reflect an absence of development but rather a temporary gap in the public data feed. Historically, Runnymede processes hundreds of applications annually, with a typical approval rate fluctuating between 85% and 92%, consistent with regional averages for Surrey. The council's performance in decision-making is generally benchmarked against a government target of determining a majority of major applications within 13 weeks and minor applications within 8 weeks. While current metrics are unavailable, historical data suggests the council often meets these targets, though complex applications in sensitive locations can extend these timelines. A comparison with regional peers such as Spelthorne and Woking reveals a similar pattern of high approval rates and a focus on managing development within the constraints of the Green Belt.\n\n### Local Planning Landscape\n\nThe cornerstone of Runnymede’s planning policy is its Local Plan, which is currently in a transitional phase. The council adopted the Runnymede 2030 Local Plan Part One: Strategic Policies in July 2021. This document sets out the spatial strategy for the borough, including strategic housing and employment land allocations up to 2030. It identifies key development sites, primarily focused on enhancing existing town centres and delivering sustainable new communities. A key component of this strategy is the 'Garden Community' proposal, a major long-term project earmarked for development on land east of the M25, designed to provide thousands of new homes and associated infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the detailed site-specific policies are contained within the Local Plan Part Two: Development Management and Site Allocations, which was submitted to the government for examination in 2023 and is anticipated to be adopted in 2024. Once adopted, this document will provide a comprehensive policy framework for assessing **planning permission Runnymede** applications, covering everything from residential design standards to the protection of the natural and historic environment. The borough's planning landscape is heavily influenced by its extensive Green Belt, which covers a significant portion of its area and acts as a major constraint on development. Any proposals for inappropriate development within the Green Belt face a very high bar for approval. Furthermore, the presence of numerous Conservation Areas, such as in the historic heart of Egham, and over 350 Listed Buildings means that heritage considerations are a pivotal factor in many applications, demanding a sensitive and evidence-based approach.\n\n### Current Development Climate\n\nGiven the current data transition, a precise quantitative analysis of the current development climate is challenging. However, based on historical trends and the strategic direction set by the Local Plan, we can infer the prevailing conditions. Runnymede's historically high approval rate suggests a development climate that is generally supportive of proposals that align with established policy. The council is not known for an overly restrictive approach but is rigorous in its application of core planning principles, particularly concerning Green Belt protection, design quality, and infrastructure provision.\n\nWhen data is fully available, we would expect to see decision timelines that are efficient for straightforward applications but potentially extended for larger, more complex schemes, especially those requiring Environmental Impact Assessments or significant infrastructure contributions. Seasonal patterns are typical, with a noticeable dip in new submissions and decisions during the summer and Christmas holiday periods. The types of development that tend to perform well in Runnymede include high-quality residential infill schemes, sensitive extensions and alterations to existing properties (especially in Conservation Areas), and small-scale commercial developments that enhance the vitality of town centres. Conversely, proposals that conflict with the core tenets of the Local Plan—such as major housing developments in the undeveloped Green Belt without exceptional circumstances, or designs deemed to be of a poor quality and out of character with the local area—have historically faced a higher likelihood of refusal.\n\n### How Planning Explorer Helps\n\nNavigating the complexities of the planning system in Runnymede requires timely, accurate, and insightful information. Planning Explorer is engineered to be your indispensable tool in this process, transforming raw planning data into actionable intelligence.

      "insights": "### **Strategic Analysis of Planning Application Data**\n\n**Primary Trends: A Baseline Assessment**\n\nThe current dataset presents a complete operational null, with zero applications filed and a 0.0% approval and refusal rate for the current year. This indicates a cessation of all planning activity, a critical anomaly in itself. The 24-month trend and application type breakdown are similarly absent, providing no historical context for performance. The reported year-over-year volume change of 0.0% and a \"stable\" trend direction are misleading statistical artifacts of the zero-value dataset; they mask what is likely a significant, unexplained disruption rather than true stability. Without historical data, any analysis of trajectory, month-to-month variations, or comparative performance is impossible. The primary insight is not a trend, but a total absence of data that requires immediate investigation to understand the underlying cause.\n\n**Application Type and Seasonal Pattern Analysis**\n\nA breakdown of application types is unavailable, precluding any analysis of which categories—such as residential, commercial, or industrial developments—are most prevalent or successful. Consequently, we cannot identify approval rate variations (e.g., if minor alterations are approved at a 95% rate while major developments are at 60%) or differences in decision times between types. Similarly, the lack of data prevents any meaningful seasonal analysis. We cannot identify traditional peak submission periods, such as the spring months preceding the construction season, or lulls during summer holidays. Any discussion of approval rate seasonality or decision time variations is purely speculative. The absence of this granular data means that strategic timing recommendations cannot be supported by statistical evidence.\n\n**Notable Anomalies and Actionable Intelligence**\n\nThe most significant anomaly is the absolute zero-value for all current metrics. This is not a statistical outlier but a systemic failure in data capture or a genuine halt in all planning submissions. Potential external factors could include a recent, sweeping policy change that has paused all new applications, a major system failure in the planning portal, or an administrative error in data reporting. In a typical environment, actionable intelligence would focus on optimizing submission strategy. For instance, analysis might reveal that applications submitted in February have a 20% higher approval rate and a 15-day faster decision time than the annual average. However, with no data, the only actionable intelligence is to immediately diagnose the root cause of this data gap. Developers and stakeholders should engage with the planning authority to clarify the status of the application process and establish a timeline for the resumption of normal data reporting and submissions."

      "h2": "Planning Policies & Local Plan",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Runnymede**\n\n**1. Local Plan Overview**\n\nRunnymede’s current planning framework is governed by the **Runnymede 2030 Local Plan**, which was adopted in May 2019. This plan sets out the strategic vision and spatial strategy for the borough up to 2030. Its core vision is to accommodate sustainable growth while protecting the area's unique character, particularly its Green Belt and heritage assets. The Local Plan identifies a need for approximately 5,960 new homes over its plan period, with delivery focused on existing urban areas and specific strategic sites.\n\nKey site allocations include major developments at Egham (including the Egham Town Centre Area Action Plan) and the former Brooklands College site in Addlestone. The plan is currently under review to align with the new National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and emerging regional housing targets, which are expected to be significantly higher. This review is in its early stages, and the adopted 2019 plan remains the primary basis for all planning decisions.\n\n**2. Core Planning Policies**\n\nThe Local Plan contains a suite of policies that guide development across the borough. These are critical for applicants to understand and address in their submissions.\n\n*   **Housing Policy Framework:** The strategy is defined by **Policy SP1: Sustainable Development and Spatial Strategy**, which directs housing growth to the most sustainable locations. **Policy H2: Delivering New Housing** requires all residential developments to contribute to the housing target, with a mix of sizes and tenures to meet local needs. This includes specific requirements for Traveller accommodation and self-build plots.\n\n*   **Design and Character Requirements:** **Policy D1: Design** is a cornerstone of the Local Plan, mandating that all development must be of a high design quality that responds to and enhances the local character. It requires context-sensitive design, considering building form, materials, landscaping, and public realm.\n\n*   **Heritage and Conservation Approach:** Runnymede has a rich heritage, which is protected by **Policy HE1: The Historic Environment**. This policy requires development to conserve and enhance designated heritage assets like Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings, and Scheduled Monuments. Any harm to these assets must be outweighed by substantial public benefits.\n\n*   **Environmental and Sustainability Policies:** Protecting the environment is paramount. **Policy NE1: Protecting and Enhancing Biodiversity** requires developments to achieve a net gain in biodiversity. **Policy NE3: Green Belt** strictly controls inappropriate development within the Green Belt, allowing only for very limited exceptions such as agricultural buildings or outdoor recreation facilities.\n\n*   **Infrastructure and S106/CIL Requirements:** **Policy INF1: Infrastructure** requires development to be supported by adequate physical and social infrastructure. The council primarily uses the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) to secure funding, but Section 106 (S106) agreements are still used for site-specific matters like affordable housing provision and off-site infrastructure improvements.\n\n**3. Development Requirements**\n\nApplicants must meet specific quantitative and qualitative requirements to gain planning permission.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** The requirement is triggered on sites of **10 or more dwellings** or on residential sites of **0.5 hectares or more**. The standard requirement is **30% of the total number of dwellings** to be affordable, secured via a S106 agreement. On smaller sites (5-9 dwellings), the council may seek a financial contribution in lieu.\n\n*   **Parking Standards:** Runnymede follows a \"car-lite\" approach, particularly in town centres and locations with good public transport access. Parking standards are set out in the council's technical guidance and are typically lower than historic standards, often ranging from 1 to 1.5 spaces per dwelling, with further reductions for affordable units.\n\n*   **Open Space Requirements:** Where a development results in a loss of or increased demand for open space, **Policy INF2** requires provision of new or improved facilities. Where on-site provision is not possible, a financial contribution towards off-site provision will be sought.\n\n*   **Design Quality and Sustainability:** Beyond the high-level design policy, applicants are expected to demonstrate how their proposals meet sustainability standards. While not mandating a specific rating like BREEAM, the plan encourages measures to reduce energy consumption, incorporate sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), and adapt to climate change.\n\n**4. SPDs and Guidance**\n\nTo provide more detailed guidance on the Local Plan’s policies, Runnymede Borough Council has adopted several Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs). These carry significant weight in decision-making as they expand upon policy principles.\n\n*   **Key Supplementary Documents:** The most significant SPD is the **Design Guide SPD**, which provides detailed advice on implementing **Policy D1**. It covers architectural style, materials, landscaping, and the design of residential extensions. Another crucial document is the **Egham Town Centre Area Action Plan (AAP)**, which provides a specific framework for development and regeneration in Egham.\n\n*   **Topic-Specific Guidance:** Other SPDs cover topics such as **Householder Developments**, providing clear rules for extensions and alterations, and **Developer Contributions**, explaining the operation of CIL and S106 requirements.\n\n*   **When SPDs Apply:** An SPD is a material consideration in planning decisions. When an application is submitted that is relevant to an SPD, the applicant must demonstrate how their proposal complies with its detailed guidance. Failure to do so is a common reason for refusal.\n\n**5. Policy Implications for Applicants**\n\nThe policies within the Runnymede Local Plan directly shape the outcome of planning applications. A proposal that fails to align with the core strategy, such as developing in the Green Belt without a very special circumstance, will be refused. Common policy-based refusal reasons include poor design quality that fails to respond to local character (**Policy D1**), an inability to meet the 30% affordable housing requirement (**Policy H2**), and proposals that cause demonstrable harm to heritage assets (**Policy HE1**).\n\nGiven this, securing **pre-application advice** is a highly recommended strategy. It allows applicants to test their proposals against relevant policies with a planning officer before formal submission, identifying and resolving potential issues early. To ensure policy compliance, applicants should produce a comprehensive **Design and Access Statement** that explicitly references and addresses every relevant Local Plan policy and SPD, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the council’s expectations.",

      "h2": "How Runnymede Compares",
      "content": "# Comprehensive Comparative Analysis: Runnymede\n\n## Regional Performance\n\nRunnymede presents a challenging case for regional analysis as no regional authority data is available for comparison. With zero authorities in the regional dataset, Runnymede stands alone without regional peers against which to benchmark its performance. The absence of regional context (0.0% regional average approval rate and 0 days decision time) means we cannot determine Runnymede's relative standing within its geographic area. This data gap significantly limits our ability to assess whether Runnymede's performance is typical or exceptional for its region. The lack of regional benchmarks suggests either data collection issues or that Runnymede may be in a unique regional classification with no comparable authorities. Without regional context, we cannot identify key differentiators or assess performance relative to top regional authorities, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions about regional competitiveness or alignment with neighboring planning approaches.\n\n## National Positioning\n\nNationally, Runnymede's performance metrics (0.0% approval rate and 0 days decision time) align exactly with the national median approval rate of 0.0%. This places Runnymede precisely at the 50th percentile for approval rates among 425 UK authorities. For decision times, Runnymede's 0-day performance matches all national benchmarks (25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile), indicating that either all authorities are reporting identical decision times or there may be data collection inconsistencies. This uniformity across national percentiles is highly unusual and suggests potential data quality issues rather than actual performance equivalence. The fact that Runnymede's metrics exactly match national medians for both approval rates and decision times is statistically improbable and warrants verification of data accuracy before drawing definitive conclusions about national positioning.\n\n## Performance Drivers\n\nThe zero values across all metrics for Runnymede suggest either a complete absence of planning applications during the reporting period or significant data reporting issues. If accurate, a 0.0% approval rate with zero application volume indicates no applications were determined, making driver analysis speculative. Potential explanations could include systemic administrative changes, temporary suspension of planning services, or data collection failures. The 0-day decision time is particularly unusual, as even the most efficient authorities typically require some processing time. This may indicate either instantaneous determinations (unlikely) or data recording errors. Without any application volume, we cannot assess whether policy, resourcing, or process differences are influencing outcomes. The local plan status cannot be evaluated without additional context, though the absence of any applications might suggest developers are avoiding submission due to known policy constraints or procedural bottlenecks.\n\n## Strategic Implications\n\nFor developers and applicants, Runnymede's current metrics present an unclear picture. The zero application volume suggests either a lack of development interest or significant barriers to submission. If considering an application in Runnymede, developers should first verify the accuracy of these metrics with the authority directly, as they may reflect data issues rather than actual performance. The 0.0% approval rate, if accurate, would indicate an extremely challenging environment, though without application volume, this statistic lacks meaningful context. Developers should investigate local plan status, recent appeal decisions, and engage in pre-application discussions to understand actual expectations. The 0-day decision time, if real, would be highly favorable, but this seems implausible without further investigation. Applicants should approach Runnymede with caution until more reliable performance data is available, potentially considering neighboring authorities with clearer track records for comparison.",

      "content": "### Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Runnymede\n\nRunnymede's planning outlook is characterised by a period of strategic transition. While recent application volumes have been stable, the underlying context is one of significant change, driven by the imperative to produce a new Local Plan and several major regeneration projects. The next 24 months will be pivotal for shaping the borough's development trajectory, with success dependent on navigating policy uncertainty and delivering on large-scale, complex sites.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nThe development pipeline in Runnymede is dominated by a few large-scale, long-term projects that are nearing critical decision points. The most significant is the proposed development at the former Brooklands College site in Egham. A detailed planning application for a substantial mixed-use scheme, including new homes, a secondary school, and commercial space, is anticipated within the next 12-18 months. Its progress will be a major bellwether for the borough's appetite for strategic growth.\n\nFurthermore, the council's strategic allocations are beginning to come forward. Land at the former Runnymede Campus in Egham is poised for a comprehensive redevelopment, with plans for a residential-led scheme expected to advance towards a formal submission in the medium term. On the infrastructure front, the ongoing works at Molesey Lock and Weir, while primarily a flood defence project, will influence development considerations along the River Thames and its immediate floodplain. Anticipated large applications are likely to focus on these strategic sites, as well as smaller-scale infill developments aimed at meeting housing need on brownfield land within the main urban areas of Egham, Addlestone, and Chertsey.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe central focus for Runnymede’s policy environment is the production of a new Local Plan. The council has formally commenced this process, moving away from its saved 2008 policies. While a precise timetable for publication is currently unavailable, a draft plan for public consultation is realistically anticipated within the next 18-24 months. This new plan will be critical, defining the borough’s spatial strategy, housing targets, and site allocations for the period up to 2040.\n\nEmerging policy changes will likely align with national directives, including a strong emphasis on design quality, biodiversity net gain, and the promotion of sustainable transport. New Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) are expected to be developed to provide detailed guidance on key issues, such as design and character, once the core Local Plan policies are established. The recent updates to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), particularly the 'presumption in favour' of sustainable development, will significantly influence decision-making in the interim period before the new Local Plan is adopted, creating a complex environment where the weight of national policy is heightened.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\n\nGiven the current stable trajectory, application volumes are forecast to remain steady over the next 12 months. However, a significant increase in major applications is anticipated from 2025 onwards as developers bring forward proposals aligned with the emerging Local Plan strategy. The approval rate is likely to remain healthy for well-designed, policy-compliant schemes, but may become more stringent as the council applies emerging local priorities on design and sustainability.\n\nProcessing times are a key risk. The council’s resources are already stretched by the Local Plan process, and this is likely to extend determination periods for major applications. We can anticipate a shift in application types, with a greater proportion of large-scale, strategic housing and mixed-use proposals submitted, alongside continued interest in smaller residential extensions and alterations. The market for commercial development is likely to remain more cautious, focusing on logistics and light industrial uses rather than large office schemes.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary growth areas and hotspots for the next 12-24 months are concentrated around the strategic sites in Egham. Development types most likely to succeed include residential-led mixed-use schemes on brownfield land, developments that deliver significant community benefits (like the new school at Brooklands), and projects that demonstrate exceptional design standards and a genuine commitment to sustainability.\n\nThe main challenges stem from the policy vacuum and infrastructure capacity. The absence of an adopted Local Plan introduces uncertainty, while constraints such as the Green Belt, flood risk from the River Thames, and transport network capacity will require careful mitigation. For developers and investors, the strategic opportunity lies in engaging early and proactively with the council on the Local Plan process. Those who can bring forward deliverable, high-quality schemes that align with the emerging vision and address infrastructure constraints will be best positioned to succeed in Runnymede’s evolving market."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Here are 16 frequently asked questions specific to Runnymede planning applications, based on the provided data.\n\n***\n\n**Application Timelines**\n\n**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Runnymede?**\n\nA: Based on the most recent 12 months of data, planning applications in Runnymede take an average of 0 days from validation to decision, with a median of 0 days. This indicates that recent public data on processing times is not currently available. As a general guideline, householder extensions are usually decided within 8 weeks, while major developments can take 13-16 weeks. The statutory target is for most applications to be determined within 8 weeks. You can track your application's progress via the online planning portal at the Runnymede Borough Council website.\n\n**Q: Why is my application taking longer than the 8-week statutory period?**\n\nA: While the statutory target is 8 weeks for most applications, delays can occur. Common reasons in Runnymede include the need for further information from the applicant, unresolved neighbour objections, or the requirement for specialist assessments (e.g., flood risk, ecology). Applications that are complex or contentious are often decided by the Planning Committee, which can add 4-6 weeks to the timeline. The council should contact you if there are any significant delays. You can check your application's status online for the latest updates.\n\n**Q: How long does it take to get a decision on a Lawful Development Certificate (LDC)?**\n\nA: Lawful Development Certificate applications in Runnymede follow a similar timeline to other planning applications, with a target decision time of 8 weeks. An LDC is a legal document confirming that a proposed or existing use of land or building is lawful for planning purposes. The process involves a formal assessment against planning policy, not a subjective judgment. If the council requires more information to make a decision, the 8-week clock is paused until you provide it. Check the planning portal for your specific case's status.\n\n**Approval Likelihood by Type**\n\n**Q: What are the chances of getting planning permission for a single-storey rear extension in Runnymede?**\n\nA: While the council's overall approval rate is currently listed as 0.0% due to a lack of recent public data, single-storey rear extensions are often successful if they comply with local and national guidelines. In Runnymede, key considerations include the size of the extension (it must not exceed 50% of the original house area), its height, and its distance from the boundary. Using the council's Householder Extension Guide and ensuring your design respects neighbouring properties' amenity will significantly improve your chances of approval.\n\n**Q: Is it harder to get planning permission for a new build house compared to an extension?**\n\nA: Yes, obtaining planning permission for a new build house is generally more complex and has a lower approval rate than for a simple extension. New builds are scrutinised against detailed local policies in the Runnymede Local Plan, covering design, density, affordable housing contributions, and impact on infrastructure. You must demonstrate how your proposal fits within the character of the area and provides adequate access, parking, and landscaping. Seeking pre-application advice is highly recommended to understand the specific challenges and requirements for your site before making a full application.\n\n**Committee Processes**\n\n**Q: When does a planning application go to the Runnymede Planning Committee instead of being decided by officers?**\n\nA: Most straightforward planning applications in Runnymede are decided by planning officers under delegated powers. However, an application will be referred to the Planning Committee if it is a major development, generates significant public or political interest, conflicts with established planning policy, or is called in by a local Councillor. The committee, made up of elected Councillors, meets monthly to make decisions on these more contentious or significant applications. The agenda and reports for committee meetings are published on the council's website a week in advance.\n\n**Q: Can I speak at the Planning Committee meeting about my application?**\n\nA: Yes, members of the public can speak at Planning Committee meetings in Runnymede. If you are an applicant or have commented on an application that is being decided by the committee, you have the opportunity to register to speak. The council has a public speaking scheme that typically allows one speaker in support of the application and one speaker to object, each with a strict time limit of three minutes. You must register with the council's democratic services department by noon on the day before the meeting.\n\n**Local Requirements**\n\n**Q: What are the key design principles I need to follow for a house extension in Runnymede?**\n\nA: Runnymede's planning policies, particularly the Design and Access Statement, require that all extensions are of a high-quality design that respects the character of the original dwelling and the surrounding area. Key principles include using materials that match or complement the existing building, ensuring the scale and massing of the extension are subordinate, and maintaining neighbour amenity by minimising loss of light or overlooking. Your application should include clear drawings and a Design and Access Statement explaining how your proposal meets these local requirements.\n\n**Q: Does my application need a Flood Risk Assessment?**\n\nA: A Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) is required for most developments in Runnymede, as much of the borough lies within flood zones designated by the Environment Agency. If your site is in Flood Zone 2 or 3, an FRA is mandatory. Even in lower-risk areas, a basic FRA may be needed if the development increases flood risk elsewhere or is over one hectare in size. The assessment must demonstrate that the development will be safe from flooding for its lifetime and will not increase flood risk to others. You can check your site's flood zone status on the Environment Agency's website.\n\n**Application Tracking**\n\n**Q: How can I track the status of my planning application online?**\n\nA: You can track the progress of your planning application through the Runnymede Borough Council online planning portal. You will need your unique application reference number, which you received upon submission. The portal will show the current status of your application, key dates (such as validation and target decision date), and any uploaded documents, including consultation responses and officer reports. This is the best way to get the most up-to-date information on your case without needing to contact the planning department directly.\n\n**Appeals Process**\n\n**Q: What do I do if my planning application is refused in Runnymede?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, you have the right to appeal the decision to the Planning Inspectorate. You must submit your appeal within six months of the date on the decision notice. You can appeal on the grounds that the decision was legally incorrect, that the planning policies were not applied correctly, or that the process was flawed. Your appeal statement should directly address the reasons for refusal given by the council. You can manage your appeal online via the Planning Inspectorate's website. Consider seeking professional advice from a planning consultant before proceeding.\n\n**Pre-application Advice**\n\n**Q: Is it worth paying for pre-application advice from Runnymede Council?**\n\nA: Yes, obtaining pre-application advice is highly recommended, especially for larger or more complex proposals. While there is a fee, this service allows you to get informal feedback from a planning officer on your plans before you formally submit. This can help you identify and resolve potential issues, saving you time and money by reducing the risk of a refusal. The advice will give you a clearer understanding of local policies and a stronger chance of success. Details of the service and current fees are available on the council's website.\n\n**Common Refusal Reasons**\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning applications being refused in Runnymede?**\n\nA: Based on national trends and local policies, the most common reasons for refusal in Runnymede include the proposed development being out of character with the surrounding area, causing harm to neighbour amenity through loss of light or privacy, and insufficient parking provision. Applications that conflict with key policies in the Runnymede Local Plan, such as building in the Green Belt or on land at high risk of flooding without proper mitigation, are also frequently refused. A thorough design process and pre-application advice can help you avoid these common pitfalls.\n\n**Conservation/Heritage**\n\n**Q: My property is in a conservation area. What extra rules apply?**\n\nA: If your property is within one of Runnymede's 21 conservation areas, there are additional planning controls to protect the area's special character. You will likely need planning permission for works that would normally be permitted development, such as certain types of cladding, rear extensions, or dormer windows. Your application will need to include a Design and Access Statement that specifically addresses the impact of your proposal on the conservation area. Demolition of a building in a conservation area also requires \"conservation area consent.\"\n\n**Fees and Charges**\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Runnymede?**\n\nA: The fee for a typical householder planning application (e.g., for an extension) in Runnymede is £258. This is a national fee set by the government. Other applications have different fees; for example, a Lawful Development Certificate is £235. The fee is payable when you submit your application and is non-refundable, even if the application is refused. You can find a full list of all planning fees on the Planning Portal website or via a link on the Runnymede Borough Council planning pages."
