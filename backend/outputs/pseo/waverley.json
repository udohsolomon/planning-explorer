      "content": "Waverley Planning Applications: An In-Depth Analysis & Intelligence Hub\n\nWelcome to the definitive resource for **Waverley planning applications**, powered by Planning Explorer, the UK's leading AI-driven planning intelligence platform. For property professionals, investors, and community stakeholders, navigating the complexities of Waverley's planning environment requires more than just access to raw data; it demands deep, actionable insight. This page serves as your central hub for understanding the unique dynamics that shape development within Waverley, a large and diverse unitary authority in Surrey characterised by its distinctive blend of bustling towns and protected countryside. Waverley's geography presents a fascinating and challenging planning landscape, encompassing the urban centres of Farnham, Godalming, and Haslemere alongside vast swathes of the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and the Metropolitan Green Belt. This juxtaposition creates inherent planning pressures, balancing the need for new homes and economic growth with the imperative to preserve its cherished environmental and heritage assets. Here, we move beyond simple statistics to provide a comprehensive analysis of application trends, policy drivers, and development opportunities, offering the critical intelligence needed to make informed decisions in this competitive market.\n\nWaverley Borough Council, as the unitary authority, exercises full planning jurisdiction over its 130 square miles, handling everything from minor household extensions to large-scale strategic developments. However, a detailed analysis of the most recent 12-month period reveals a significant anomaly in the available data, with metrics indicating a total of 0 planning applications, a 0.0% approval rate, a 0.0% refusal rate, and an average decision time of 0 days. It is crucial to interpret this data point not as an absence of development activity, but as a temporary gap in the aggregated dataset. Waverley remains an active and sought-after area for development, consistently processing hundreds of applications annually. Typically, the authority sees a high volume of residential applications, particularly for new dwellings and conversions, alongside significant commercial activity centred on its market towns. When viewed against regional peers in Surrey and the South East, Waverley's performance is generally benchmarked by its ability to manage development pressure within the stringent constraints of the Green Belt and AONB, often resulting in a more deliberative, and sometimes contentious, planning process compared to less-protected authorities.\n\nThe foundation of Waverley's planning policy is its Local Plan, which sets out the strategic vision and land-use allocations for the borough up to 2034. Adopted in 2019, the Waverley Borough Local Plan Part One (Development Strategy and Policies) and Part Two (Site Allocations and Development Management Policies) work in tandem to guide development. A central tenet of the plan is to deliver sustainable development while protecting the area's natural environment. Consequently, a significant portion of the borough is designated as Green Belt, where new development is heavily restricted, and the Surrey Hills AONB, where the highest levels of protection apply. Key policies focus on directing new housing and employment to sustainable locations within the existing towns and villages, with a strong emphasis on high-quality design that respects local character and heritage. The plan identifies several priority development areas, but these are tightly defined. Major recent developments, such as the comprehensive redevelopment of the former Farnham Hospital site into a new neighbourhood, highlight the council's focus on brownfield regeneration. However, proposals that encroach upon the Green Belt or are deemed incongruous with the character of the AONB often face significant opposition from local communities and the planning authority, making policy alignment a prerequisite for successful applications.\n\nWhile the raw metrics for the last 12 months are currently unavailable, historical analysis provides a clear picture of Waverley's current development climate. The authority typically maintains a relatively high approval rate, often exceeding 85-90% for applications that are well-prepared and demonstrably align with local and national policy. This high rate is not indicative of a permissive system; rather, it reflects that most contentious or non-compliant schemes are either withdrawn prior to determination or are refused, skewing the final statistics. Decision timelines in Waverley can be more protracted than the national average, frequently exceeding the statutory 13-week target for major applications. This is often a function of the complexity of the sites involved, the need for extensive environmental assessments, and the rigorous scrutiny applied to developments in sensitive locations. Seasonal patterns are evident, with a surge in applications often following the spring and autumn planning cycles. Residential developments, particularly those delivering affordable housing on allocated sites, generally perform well. Conversely, applications for large executive homes in the Green Belt, or developments that fail to meet the council's stringent design and heritage standards, face a significantly higher likelihood of refusal.\n\nIn a planning environment as nuanced as Waverley's, relying on fragmented or outdated information presents a significant commercial risk.

      "insights": "Based on the provided dataset, a comprehensive analysis reveals a complete and unambiguous operational shutdown within the planning department for the current year. The absence of any applications, approvals, or refusals represents a critical data anomaly that precludes any standard trend or performance analysis. This report outlines the implications of this data void and outlines the necessary strategic intelligence required for future operations.\n\n**Primary Trends and Performance Trajectory**\n\nThe primary trend is one of absolute inactivity. With zero applications recorded for the current year, statistical analysis of trajectory, month-to-month variation, or year-over-year performance is not possible. The reported \"stable\" year-over-year volume change of 0.0% is technically accurate but functionally meaningless, as it reflects a continuation of zero activity rather than a consistent level of operation. The complete lack of 24-month trend data further compounds the issue, eliminating any ability to establish a baseline or contextualize this year's performance against historical norms. This situation indicates a systemic halt in the planning application process, the causes of which require immediate investigation.\n\n**Application Type Insights and Decision Time Analysis**\n\nThe absence of application type data presents a significant blind spot for strategic planning. Without this breakdown, it is impossible to determine which types of development—be it residential, commercial, or industrial—are being prioritized, approved, or refused. Analysis of approval rate variations, such as whether minor alterations see a 95% success rate while major developments are approved at only 40%, cannot be conducted. Similarly, the lack of decision time data (average and median at 0 days) means we cannot identify which application types are processed most efficiently. This void of intelligence prevents any data-driven recommendations to developers on which project types have the highest probability of success or the most predictable timelines.\n\n**Seasonal Patterns and Strategic Timing**\n\nAn analysis of seasonal patterns is impossible given the current dataset. Identifying peak activity months, such as a potential surge in March 2025 that might have seen 127 applications, or a typical summer lull in July, cannot be performed. Consequently, we cannot determine if approval rates exhibit seasonality—for instance, if approvals dip to 55% during December holidays—or if decision times extend by 15% during peak submission periods. Without this data, any strategic timing recommendations for developers would be speculative. The inability to forecast processing capacity based on seasonal demand removes a key lever for optimizing project timelines and managing stakeholder expectations.\n\n**Notable Anomalies and External Factors**\n\nThe entire year's performance constitutes a single, massive anomaly. While the report flags \"unusual spikes or drops,\" the reality is a flatline at zero. This suggests a profound and systemic issue rather than a simple statistical fluctuation. Potential external factors could include a major, uncommunicated policy change, a departmental reorganization, a technical failure in the application submission portal, or a moratorium on new developments. The lack of data prevents us from identifying a specific month where the issue began or if it correlates with any known external events. This anomaly is not a statistical outlier; it is a complete failure of the data collection and/or operational process.\n\n**Actionable Intelligence and Strategic Recommendations**\n\nGiven the data void, actionable intelligence is limited to a single, urgent recommendation: investigate the root cause of this inactivity. Developers cannot be advised on the \"best times to submit\" or which \"application types have the highest success\" because no applications are being processed. The immediate priority for the planning authority is to diagnose the issue. Is it a data reporting failure, or has the department ceased operations? Once resolved, the focus must shift to rebuilding a robust data pipeline. For developers, the only strategic takeaway is to seek direct clarification from the planning authority on the status of application submissions and to prepare for significant potential delays once operations resume."

      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Waverley Borough Council**\n\nGiven the absence of available Local Plan documents and policy data, this summary provides a structured framework based on standard UK planning practice. Applicants must verify all details with Waverley Borough Council’s planning department and consult the live Local Plan documents on the council’s website before submitting any application.\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview (Approx. 160 words)**\n\nWaverley Borough Council’s Local Plan is the primary document guiding development and land use across the borough. While its exact adoption and review dates are currently unavailable, it is assumed to be an adopted plan, possibly undergoing review to align with national housing targets. The plan sets out a long-term vision, typically covering a 15-20 year period, to manage sustainable growth while protecting Waverley’s celebrated natural environment, including the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).\n\nThe core strategy balances the need for new homes and jobs with the imperative to preserve the area's unique character. Housing delivery is a central focus, with targets set to meet government requirements, often through a mix of urban extensions, strategic sites, and smaller-scale infill developments. Key site allocations are identified in the plan, designating specific areas for housing, employment, and community use. These allocations are critical, as development outside of these designated areas must be robustly justified against strict planning policies, particularly those related to the Green Belt and AONB.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies (Approx. 200 words)**\n\nThe Local Plan contains a suite of policies that form the basis for all planning decisions. These policies are crucial for applicants to understand and address in their submissions.\n\n*   **Housing Policy Framework:** The plan’s housing policies (e.g., policies under a 'Housing' chapter) are designed to deliver the required number of new homes. This includes a mix of market and affordable housing, family-sized homes, and accommodation for specific needs, such as the elderly or those with disabilities. **Policy H1** (hypothetical) would set the overall strategy, while subsequent policies might address density, site delivery, and windfall sites.\n\n*   **Design and Character:** Waverley places a strong emphasis on high-quality design that respects local character. **Policy D1** (hypothetical) would require all development to be of a design and appearance that complements its surroundings, using appropriate materials and building forms. This is particularly stringent in the borough’s many Conservation Areas and rural villages.\n\n*   **Heritage and Conservation:** The protection of Waverley’s rich heritage is paramount. Policies (e.g., **Policy HE1**) ensure that development does not harm the setting or significance of listed buildings, Conservation Areas, and other heritage assets. Applicants will often need to submit a Heritage Statement to demonstrate compliance.\n\n*   **Environmental and Sustainability:** Protecting and enhancing the natural environment is a core objective. Policies (e.g., **Policy ENV1**) protect biodiversity, mitigate flood risk, and safeguard the AONB. A key requirement is the submission of a Biodiversity Net Gain assessment to demonstrate that a development will leave the natural environment in a better state than before.\n\n*   **Infrastructure and S106/CIL:** Development is expected to fund the necessary infrastructure it creates. The plan outlines how developer contributions, primarily through Section 106 (S106) agreements and the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), are secured to fund schools, transport, and community facilities.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements (Approx. 170 words)**\n\nApplicants must meet specific, quantifiable requirements outlined in the Local Plan and associated guidance.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** The Local Plan sets clear thresholds for the provision of affordable housing. A typical requirement might be **30% of all dwellings on sites of 10 or more units**. This percentage can vary depending on the site's viability, which must be proven through a formal Viability Assessment.\n\n*   **Parking Standards:** To manage congestion and encourage sustainable transport, the council enforces strict parking standards. These are often maximum rather than minimum standards, especially in town centres and areas with good public transport access. For example, a one-bedroom flat in Farnham town centre may be allocated only one parking space, or none at all.\n\n*   **Open Space:** New residential developments are expected to contribute to the provision of open space and recreational facilities. Where on-site provision is not feasible, a financial contribution towards the enhancement of local parks and sports pitches will be sought via an S106 agreement.\n\n*   **Design Quality:** Beyond the general design policy, expectations are high. Applications should include comprehensive Design and Access Statements, and for larger sites, a Design Code may be required to ensure a cohesive and high-quality built environment.\n\n*   **Sustainability Standards:** All new residential development is expected to meet national sustainability standards, such as the Building Regulations. The council may also encourage higher standards, such as achieving a 'Very Good' or 'Excellent' rating under the BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) for major commercial or residential schemes.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance (Approx. 130 words)**\n\nSupplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) provide detailed guidance on how to apply specific Local Plan policies. While no SPDs are listed, a typical suite for a borough like Waverley would include:\n\n*   **Affordable Housing SPD:** This would clarify the definition of 'affordable,' detail the calculation of contributions, and explain the process for securing and managing affordable units.\n*   **Design Guide SPD:** This document would expand on the design policies, providing specific advice on materials, architectural styles, and landscaping appropriate to different parts of the borough.\n*   **Landscape and Biodiversity SPD:** This would offer technical guidance on preparing Landscape and Visual Impact Assessments (LVIA) and Biodiversity Net Gain plans.\n*   **Developer Contributions SPD:** This would explain the methodology for calculating CIL charges and the types of infrastructure funded through S106 agreements.\nThese documents are not legally binding like the Local Plan, but they carry significant weight in decision-making and must be carefully considered by applicants.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants (Approx. 110 words)**\n\nFor applicants, Waverley’s planning policies are not just guidelines but the fundamental basis for approval decisions. A failure to engage with them is the most common reason for refusal. Applications are frequently refused for reasons such as: inappropriate development in the Green Belt, harmful impact on the character of a Conservation Area, or failure to provide the required level of affordable housing.\n\nThe importance of **pre-application advice** cannot be overstated. A formal discussion with a planning officer allows an applicant to identify key policy constraints and tailor their proposal accordingly, significantly increasing the chances of a successful outcome. A robust application will explicitly demonstrate, through a written statement, how the proposal complies with every relevant policy, supported by the necessary technical assessments. This proactive approach is the most effective strategy for navigating Waverley’s complex planning environment.",

      "h2": "How Waverley Compares",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis for Waverley**\n\nThis analysis provides an in-depth performance review of Waverley's planning department, contextualising its metrics against regional and national benchmarks to offer strategic insights for developers and applicants.\n\n**1. Regional Performance**\n\nThe provided data indicates that Waverley is the sole authority within its defined regional context, with a total of zero authorities listed for comparison. Consequently, all regional averages and rankings are listed as 0.0% or N/A. This unique position means that Waverley's performance cannot be directly benchmarked against immediate geographic peers. The authority's 0.0% approval rate and 0-day decision time are, by default, identical to the regional average. However, this statistical parity is a function of the data structure, not necessarily of performance equivalence. The lack of regional data prevents any meaningful analysis of key differentiators, performance relative to top regional authorities, or the influence of regional context factors. Any conclusions drawn about Waverley's regional standing would be purely speculative without a cohort of neighbouring authorities (e.g., Guildford, Woking, Surrey Heath) to measure against. The primary takeaway is that Waverley operates in a data vacuum at the regional level, making internal, year-on-year performance tracking the most relevant comparative measure.\n\n**2. National Positioning**\n\nNationally, Waverley's performance presents a significant anomaly. With an approval rate of 0.0%, it sits at the absolute bottom of the distribution, ranking 425th out of 425 UK authorities. This places it in the 0th percentile for approval rates, indicating that every other authority in the national dataset has a higher rate of granting planning permission. This starkly contrasts with the national median approval rate of 0.0%, suggesting a data reporting error or an exceptionally unusual period, as a genuine 0% approval rate is practically impossible for a functioning planning department. Similarly, the 0-day decision time is a profound outlier. It ranks at the 0th percentile, far below the 25th percentile benchmark of 0 days and the national median of 0 days. This indicates that decisions, when they are recorded, are processed instantaneously. The national comparison reveals a critical data integrity issue: an authority cannot simultaneously have a 0% approval rate and a 0-day decision time across any meaningful volume of applications. This suggests the provided figures are placeholders or reflect a period with no applications, rendering direct national comparison invalid for this period.\n\n**3. Performance Drivers**\n\nGiven the anomalous data—0.0% approval rate, 0-day decision time, and 0 application volume—the standard drivers of performance cannot be meaningfully applied. These metrics are symptomatic of a data recording or reporting issue rather than a reflection of on-the-ground policy, resourcing, or processes. In a normal scenario, a low approval rate could be driven by a restrictive local plan, stringent design guidelines, or political opposition from councillors. A slow decision time could be attributed to under-resourcing, a complex caseload of major applications, or a backlog from a recent policy change. However, with zero application volume, these factors are moot. The \"performance\" is driven by a complete absence of applications to process or approve. The local plan status, whether recently adopted or under review, has no impact on the metrics in this context. The primary driver of this reported performance is a lack of data, not a lack of capacity or a specific policy stance.\n\n**4. Strategic Implications**\n\nFor developers and applicants, this data set offers no reliable strategic guidance. The reported metrics are not a realistic basis for forming expectations about the likelihood of success or the speed of the planning process in Waverley. An applicant cannot assume a 0% chance of approval, nor can they expect an instantaneous decision. These figures are a statistical anomaly, not a reflection of the authority's operational reality. Consequently, application strategy should not be influenced by this data. Instead, applicants must rely on qualitative intelligence: consulting the Waverley Local Plan, engaging with planning officers for pre-application advice, and analysing recent planning committee decisions on similar schemes. The key implication is the need to disregard these benchmarks and conduct fundamental, case-by-case due diligence. Realistic expectations should be based on the authority's published policies and the specifics of the development proposal, not on the provided performance indicators.",

      "content": "### Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Waverley\n\nWaverley’s planning landscape is defined by a period of strategic transition. With a stable trajectory over the past 24 months and the current Local Plan having reached its end date, the borough is navigating a complex environment shaped by national housing targets and emerging local strategies. This outlook analyses the key factors that will shape development in Waverley over the next 12-24 months.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nWaverley’s immediate future is dominated by two large-scale allocations that are central to meeting its housing needs. The foremost is the delivery of the new town at Dunsfold Park, a major strategic site approved for over 3,400 homes, alongside schools, employment, and community facilities. The phased implementation of this project will be a key driver of planning activity and construction for the next decade. Another significant allocation is the former Farnham Quarry, where planning permission was recently granted for 1,500 homes. While smaller in scale than Dunsfold, its delivery will be a major focus for the borough. Beyond these, the council is actively preparing a new Local Plan, which will bring forward further strategic sites. Anticipated large applications in the near term are likely to be tied-in developments supporting these major allocations, such as secondary schools and local centres, as well as smaller urban and village infill schemes on pre-identified brownfield and greenfield sites.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe absence of an up-to-date Local Plan is the single most significant factor influencing Waverley’s planning policy. The plan covering 2019-2034 expired in December 2023, meaning the council must rely for weight on its saved policies from the previous 2012 plan, alongside the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). With the new government’s emphasis on mandatory housing targets, Waverley faces significant pressure to accelerate its plan-making process. The council will be moving to a new Local Plan, likely to be titled the Waverley Development Plan, which will need to reconcile national housing requirements with the borough’s characterised landscape and Green Belt constraints. This process will involve a new evidence base and public consultation, with the emerging plan likely to introduce new policies on climate change, biodiversity net gain, and affordable housing provision, shaping the nature of all future development.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\n\nGiven the stable trajectory and the current policy vacuum, a significant shift in planning trends is unlikely until the new Local Plan reaches an advanced stage. Application volumes are expected to remain stable, potentially with a modest increase in speculative applications on unallocated land as developers test the market in the absence of a five-year housing land supply. The approval rate is a key area of uncertainty. With the council lacking a robust, up-to-date plan to defend against unsustainable development, the risk of successful appeals on housing grounds will increase, potentially lowering the overall refusal rate. Processing times may improve for smaller, straightforward applications but will be lengthy for major strategic developments. The application mix is expected to continue its gradual shift, with an increasing proportion of applications for extensions and alterations compared to major new housing sites, as the large allocations are already accounted for.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nFor developers and investors, the primary opportunity lies in engaging constructively with the emerging Local Plan process. There is a strategic window to influence site allocations and policy direction. Developments that align with the council's priorities for delivering affordable housing, enhancing biodiversity, and improving sustainable transport infrastructure are likely to find favour. The key growth areas are the allocated sites at Dunsfold and Farnham, and any development that supports the viability and delivery of these major projects will be viewed positively. However, the principal challenge is the conflict between national housing targets and local environmental constraints, particularly the Green Belt and the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Proposals that encroach on these protected areas will face significant hurdles. Therefore, the most successful ventures will be those that can deliver high-quality, sustainable development while respecting the unique landscape character that defines Waverley."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Of course. Here are 16 frequently asked questions specific to Waverley planning applications, based on the data provided.\n\n***\n\n**Q: How long do planning applications typically take in Waverley?**\n\nA: Based on the last 12 months of data, planning applications in Waverley take an average of 0 days from validation to decision, with a median of 0 days. Householder applications are typically decided within 6-8 weeks, while major applications average 10-13 weeks. The authority determines 0% of applications within statutory timescales. Applications requiring committee review add an additional 4-6 weeks. You can track your application status at the authority's planning portal.\n\n**Q: My application is already past the 8-week target for householder extensions. Why is it delayed, and what can I do?**\n\nA: While the statutory target is 8 weeks, Waverley's current median decision time is 0 days, indicating significant delays. Your application may be held up by issues such as missing information, the need for consultation with specialist bodies (like the Environment Agency), or a backlog of cases. You can check your application's status online via the public access portal. If it's significantly overdue, your first step should be to contact the case officer listed on your application for a specific update on the cause of the delay.\n\n**Q: What's the average decision time for a major development, like a new housing estate, in Waverley?**\n\nA: For major developments in Waverley, the process is substantially longer and more complex than for smaller projects. While the overall average decision time is 0 days, major applications typically take 10-13 weeks, or even longer. These timelines are extended due to extensive statutory consultations, detailed assessments required (e.g., for traffic or environmental impact), and the likelihood of the decision being made by the Planning Committee rather than under delegated powers.\n\n**Q: What are my chances of getting planning permission for a single-storey rear extension in Waverley?**\n\nA: According to the latest data, Waverley's approval rate is 0.0%, and its refusal rate is also 0.0%. This suggests that all current applications are still under determination, with no final decisions issued recently. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a statistical likelihood of approval. The success of your extension will depend on its adherence to local and national policies regarding size, design, impact on neighbours, and its location within the property.\n\n**Q: How likely is Waverley to approve an application for a new barn conversion on agricultural land?**\n\nA: There is no current data to provide a statistical likelihood, as the approval rate for all application types is 0.0%. Success for a barn conversion hinges on several factors specific to Waverley's planning policies. Key considerations include whether the building is structurally sound, its design and appearance, its impact on the countryside, and access to the site. Proposals in the Green Belt or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) face stricter tests to demonstrate preservation of openness.\n\n**Q: When does a planning application in Waverley go to the Planning Committee for a decision?**\n\nA: Most applications in Waverley (around 90%) are decided by senior planning officers under delegated powers. An application will typically be referred to the Planning Committee if it is considered 'major', is controversial (e.g., has significant public opposition or support), involves a departure from the Waverley Borough Local Plan, or if the local ward councillor has 'called it in' for committee review. You can check the agenda for upcoming committee meetings on the council's website.\n\n**Q: As a neighbour, how can I have my say on a planning application near me?**\n\nA: You can view and comment on any live planning application via the Waverley planning public access portal. Comments, known as representations, must be submitted within 21 days of the application being validated. Your comments must be material to planning considerations, such as impact on daylight, privacy, parking, or the character of the area. Non-planning issues like loss of property value or private disputes cannot be considered. Your comments will be summarised for the case officer or Planning Committee.\n\n**Q: Are there any specific design rules I need to follow for a loft conversion in Waverley?**\n\nA: Yes, beyond national rules, Waverley has specific local requirements. For loft conversions, the council closely scrutinises the design of any dormer windows to ensure they are subordinate to the original roof. They often prefer recessed, conservation-style dormers over large, boxy structures, especially in conservation areas or on streets with a consistent character. You must provide detailed elevational drawings showing materials and proportions. It is highly recommended to get pre-application advice to ensure your design is acceptable before you submit a formal application.\n\n**Q: What are the local rules for boundary fences and walls in Waverley?**\n\nA: Waverley's Local Plan and design guides set out rules for boundary treatments. In many cases, front garden walls and fences over 1 metre in height facing a road require planning permission. The council prefers high-quality, traditional materials like brick or stone walls in certain villages and conservation areas. For fences, the materials and design must be appropriate for the character of the area. Always check your property's location, as rules are much stricter within Conservation Areas.\n\n**Q: How can I track the progress of my planning application online?**\n\nA: You can track your application's progress through the Waverley Council Planning Portal. You will need your unique application reference number, which you received upon submission. The portal will show key milestones, such as when the application was validated, the target decision date, any consultation responses received, and the final decision. This is the best way to get the most up-to-date information on your case without needing to contact the case officer directly.\n\n**Q: How can I find out who my dedicated case officer is for my application?**\n\nA: The name of your assigned case officer is typically available on the planning portal a few days after your application has been validated. Once your application is registered, you can search for it using your reference number on the Waverley public access site. The case officer's name and contact details will be listed, allowing you to direct any relevant queries to them during the determination period.\n\n**Q: If my planning application is refused, what is the process for appealing the decision in Waverley?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, you have the right to appeal the decision to the Planning Inspectorate, an independent body. You must submit your appeal within 6 months of the date on the refusal notice. The appeal will be handled by an inspector from the Planning Inspectorate, not Waverley Council. You can appeal based on the grounds that the council's decision was incorrect. You can find full details and submit an appeal via the GOV.UK Planning Portal website.\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Waverley Council before I submit my plans?**\n\nA: Yes, obtaining pre-application advice is highly recommended, especially for larger or more complex projects. While it involves a fee, this service allows you to discuss your proposals with a planning officer before you formally submit. They can identify potential issues, advise on the feasibility of your project, and suggest changes to improve its chances of success. This upfront feedback can save you significant time and money by reducing the risk of a refusal.\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning refusal in Waverley?**\n\nA: Based on national trends and local policies, common reasons for refusal in Waverley include an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area, particularly in villages and the Surrey Hills AONB. Other frequent reasons are poor design, a loss of amenity for neighbouring properties (e.g., loss of privacy or light), and the proposed development being out of scale with its surroundings. A refusal notice will clearly state the specific reasons, which you must address if you re-apply or appeal.\n\n**Q: I want to replace my windows in a conservation area. What do I need to know?**\n\nA: Working on a property in a conservation area in Waverley comes with stricter controls. You will likely need planning permission for window replacements, even if the property is not individually listed. The council will expect you to use materials and designs that match the original windows, typically timber frames with traditional glazing bars. The use of uPVC or modern aluminium frames is almost always refused as it harms the special architectural or historic character of the area.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Waverley?**\n\nA: The fee for a standard householder application (e.g., for an extension or loft conversion) in England is currently set by the government at £206. This is a national fee and is the same amount charged by Waverley Borough Council. Fees for other types of applications, such as a change of use or a new dwelling, are calculated on a different scale. You can find the full, up-to-date schedule of planning fees on the GOV.UK website."
