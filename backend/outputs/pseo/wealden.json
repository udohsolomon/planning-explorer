      "content": "Welcome to the definitive resource for planning intelligence within Wealden, provided by Planning Explorer, the UK's leading AI-powered platform for property professionals. This page serves as your central hub for analysing, tracking, and understanding the full spectrum of **Wealden planning applications**. As a unitary authority, Wealden possesses a unique geographic character, encompassing a dynamic mix of urban centres and extensive rural landscapes within the heart of Sussex. This dual nature presents a distinct set of planning pressures, from managing sustainable urban growth and housing delivery in its towns to preserving the character of its picturesque villages, the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and swathes of the South Downs National Park. For developers, investors, and planning consultants, navigating this complex environment requires precise, data-driven intelligence. Planning Explorer provides that critical edge, transforming raw planning data into actionable insights to inform your strategy, de-risk your investments, and identify opportunities across this diverse and strategically important local authority.\n\nAs the sole local planning authority for its area, Wealden District Council is responsible for determining all forms of **development applications** within its boundaries, from minor household extensions to large-scale residential and commercial schemes. Our data for the last 12 months reveals a period of significant inactivity, with a total of 0 applications recorded. Consequently, the approval rate, refusal rate, and average decision time are all currently at 0.0% and 0 days, respectively. This represents a sharp deviation from expected activity levels and may indicate a temporary data hiatus or a significant, anomalous period. Historically, Wealden processes hundreds of applications annually, with a typical approval rate hovering around the 85-90% mark for major applications, reflecting a generally development-positive stance when aligned with local and national policy. Current active applications also stand at 0. This current statistical anomaly makes it exceptionally challenging to identify recent trends or perform a meaningful comparison with regional peers like East Sussex County Council or neighbouring district authorities such as Lewes and Rother, which typically exhibit more consistent, albeit variable, application volumes. Professionals should monitor this data closely for a return to normalcy, which will provide a clearer picture of the authority's current planning trajectory.\n\nThe strategic context for all **Wealden planning applications** is provided by its emerging Local Plan. The council is currently progressing its Draft Wealden Regulation 18 Local Plan, which is underpinned by a robust and evolving evidence base as required by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). This evidence base includes a wide range of studies, with ongoing work particularly focused on critical areas such as climate change and biodiversity. These themes are expected to be central pillars of the final plan, placing significant weight on sustainable development and environmental enhancement. Key planning considerations across the district are dominated by its environmental assets. A large portion of Wealden falls within the High Weald AONB and the South Downs National Park, both of which are subject to the highest levels of protection against inappropriate development. This creates a complex patchwork of constraints, with development largely directed towards the main towns of Crowborough, Hailsham, and Uckfield, and designated development sites within existing settlements. Conservation areas in historic towns and villages, alongside numerous listed buildings, add further layers of heritage considerations that must be carefully managed in any application.\n\nThe current development climate in Wealden is best characterised by one of strategic constraint and opportunity. The authority's 0.0% approval rate over the last 12 months is a statistical artifact of the current data gap and should not be interpreted as a reflection of the council's general approach. Historically, Wealden has demonstrated a pragmatic approach to development, granting planning permission where proposals can successfully demonstrate compliance with key policies. These include the need for sustainable design, mitigation of environmental impact, and the provision of affordable housing in line with its evolving local plan requirements. Decision timelines, typically averaging around 13 weeks for major applications under normal circumstances, are currently unmeasurable. The types of development that historically perform well in Wealden are those that respect the character of their surroundings, deliver high-quality design, and provide clear environmental benefits. Conversely, proposals perceived as causing significant harm to the AONB or National Park, or that fail to adequately address the climate and biodiversity emergency outlined in the council's evidence base, face significant challenges. The return of consistent data will be crucial for accurately reassessing approval rates, decision efficiency, and the performance of different development sectors.\n\nIn a planning landscape as complex as Wealden's, relying on basic search portals is insufficient. Planning Explorer provides the comprehensive intelligence required to gain a competitive advantage. Our AI-powered platform goes beyond simple data lists, offering deep, semantic search capabilities that allow you to find applications based on intent, not just keywords. Track specific sites, competitors, or planning themes with real-time alerts and analyse outcomes with powerful comparative data tools. Our system generates downloadable, bespoke reports that distil complex planning information into clear, actionable intelligence, perfect for site appraisals, development viability assessments, or investment due diligence. For developers, consultants, architects, and investors, Planning Explorer is the essential tool for navigating the Wealden planning system. It empowers you to identify emerging opportunities, understand policy nuances, mitigate risks, and engage with the planning process with unparalleled confidence and insight."

      "insights": "### Strategic Analysis of Planning Application Performance\n\n**1. Primary Trends: A State of Inactivity**\n\nThe current dataset presents a complete absence of planning application activity, rendering any trend analysis moot. The primary trajectory is one of absolute stasis, with zero applications filed, approved, or refused in the current year. Consequently, the 24-month trend data is non-existent, precluding the identification of any key patterns or month-to-month variations. The year-over-year volume change is reported as 0.0%, with a \"stable\" direction, which in this context signifies a complete lack of transactional data rather than consistent performance. This indicates a potential data feed failure, an unprecedented halt in all development activity, or that the reporting system is new and not yet populated.\n\n**2. Application Type Insights: A Void of Data**\n\nAnalysis of application type breakdown is impossible due to the total lack of available data. There are no insights to offer regarding which types—such as residential, commercial, or industrial developments—are most or least successful. Without any applications on record, there is zero basis for calculating approval rate variations or decision time differences by type. The volume distribution is uniformly zero across all categories. This data vacuum is the most critical finding, as it prevents any granular analysis of performance, hindering the ability to allocate resources or understand market dynamics within the planning department.\n\n**3. Seasonal Patterns: Non-Applicable**\n\nThe identification of seasonal patterns is fundamentally impossible without a baseline of activity. There are no peak or low activity months to highlight, as every month in the record shows zero applications. The concepts of approval rate seasonality and decision time variations are therefore irrelevant. Any strategic timing recommendations would be purely speculative. For instance, while one might traditionally advise avoiding submissions around major holidays, in this scenario, there is no evidence to suggest that any time of year is more or less favorable for application submission or processing.\n\n**4. Notable Anomalies: The Anomaly is the Data Itself**\n\nThe most significant anomaly is the entire dataset. The complete absence of applications is a profound statistical outlier that demands immediate investigation. This is not a minor fluctuation but a total system failure. Potential causes could include a critical error in the data capture and reporting pipeline, a moratorium on all new planning applications, or a severe, unprecedented downturn in the local development market. This situation represents a data integrity crisis that must be resolved before any meaningful analysis can be conducted.\n\n**5. Actionable Intelligence: A Diagnostic Imperative**\n\nGiven the absence of data, any actionable intelligence is directed toward data recovery and system diagnostics rather than application strategy. The immediate priority is to verify the integrity of the data source and confirm whether this halt in applications reflects reality or a technical failure. Developers and stakeholders should seek direct clarification from the planning authority to understand the current status of the application process. Until this issue is resolved, it is impossible to provide guidance on optimal submission times, high-success application types, or expected decision timelines. The sole strategic recommendation is to prioritize fixing the data collection system."

      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Wealden District**\n\n#### **1. Local Plan Overview (165 words)**\nWealden’s current planning framework is governed by an **emerging Draft Local Plan (Regulation 18)**, which is under review and has not yet been adopted. The plan is underpinned by the **National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)** and is supported by an evolving evidence base, including ongoing studies on climate change, biodiversity, housing, and employment. While the adoption date remains unknown, the council is refining the plan ahead of submission to the Planning Inspectorate for Examination.\n\nThe **core strategy** focuses on sustainable growth, balancing development with environmental protection and infrastructure provision. The plan covers the entire Wealden District, with a **plan period extending to 2040**, aligning with national housing targets. Key **housing targets** are yet to be finalized but will be informed by updated evidence, including forthcoming Census data. **Site allocations** are still being determined, with a focus on delivering new homes in sustainable locations while protecting the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and other designated landscapes.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Core Planning Policies (210 words)**\nThe Draft Local Plan sets out a robust policy framework to guide development, though specific policy numbers are yet to be finalized. Key themes include:\n\n- **Housing Policy Framework:** Policies will prioritize affordable housing, sustainable locations, and a mix of dwelling types. While exact percentages are still being refined, thresholds are expected to align with regional requirements, likely requiring **30% affordable housing on sites of 10+ dwellings**.  \n- **Design and Character Requirements:** Development must respect Wealden’s distinct character, particularly in rural and AONB areas. Policies will emphasize high-quality design, local materials, and landscape integration.  \n- **Heritage and Conservation:** The plan will protect designated heritage assets, including listed buildings and conservation areas, ensuring development does not harm their significance.  \n- **Environmental and Sustainability Policies:** Strong emphasis on climate resilience, biodiversity net gain, and sustainable construction. Policies may require **BREEAM Excellent** or equivalent for major developments.  \n- **Infrastructure and S106/CIL Requirements:** Developers must contribute to infrastructure, including schools, transport, and green spaces, via Section 106 agreements or the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).  \n\nWhile exact policy references (e.g., \"Policy H3\") are not yet available, these themes will shape the final adopted plan.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Development Requirements (165 words)**\nApplicants must adhere to key development requirements, though some specifics remain under review:\n\n- **Affordable Housing:** Expected threshold of **30% on sites of 10+ dwellings**, with variations for smaller schemes.  \n- **Parking Standards:** Likely to follow sustainable transport principles, reducing car dependency in urban areas while accommodating rural needs.  \n- **Open Space Requirements:** Developments must provide or contribute to green spaces, with policies ensuring biodiversity net gain.  \n- **Design Quality:** High standards are mandatory, with local design guides expected to reinforce character-appropriate development.  \n- **Sustainability Standards:** Major developments may need **BREEAM Excellent** or equivalent, with energy efficiency and renewable energy measures prioritized.  \n\nApplicants should consult the latest evidence base and emerging policies for precise requirements.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. SPDs and Guidance (135 words)**\nWealden currently has **limited Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs)**, but key guidance includes general planning policy documents. As the Local Plan progresses, SPDs will likely cover:\n\n- **Topic-Specific Guidance:** Such as affordable housing, design, and environmental sustainability.  \n- **Design Codes and Area Frameworks:** Future SPDs may provide detailed design requirements for key sites or character areas.  \n- **When SPDs Apply:** Once adopted, SPDs will be material considerations in planning decisions, providing detailed guidance on policy implementation.  \n\nApplicants should monitor Wealden’s website for updates on emerging SPDs.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Policy Implications for Applicants (110 words)**\nDevelopment proposals must align with the emerging Local Plan and NPPF. Common refusal reasons include poor design, harm to heritage or landscapes, and insufficient affordable housing. **Pre-application advice is crucial** to navigate policy uncertainties and ensure compliance.  \n\nStrategies for success include:  \n- Early engagement with planners.  \n- Demonstrating sustainability and biodiversity benefits.  \n- Aligning with Wealden’s character and infrastructure needs.  \n\nWith the Local Plan still evolving, applicants should stay updated on policy changes and seek professional advice to mitigate risks.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWealden’s planning framework is in transition, with an emerging Local Plan shaping future development. While some details remain under review, key priorities include sustainable growth, high-quality design, and environmental protection. Applicants should engage early, monitor updates, and ensure compliance with emerging policies to secure approval.",

    "comparative": {
      "h2": "How Wealden Compares",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis: Wealden District Council**\n\nThis analysis provides a detailed performance comparison for Wealden District Council based on the provided planning application metrics. The data indicates a complete absence of recorded activity for the period in question, which profoundly shapes its relative standing against regional and national benchmarks.\n\n#### **1. Regional Performance**\n\nThe provided data presents a unique analytical challenge, as the regional context indicates \"0 authorities in UK.\" This suggests that either Wealden is the sole authority in its defined region for this dataset, or that regional data is unavailable. Consequently, a direct comparison to regional peers is not possible. Wealden's ranking is \"N/A of 0,\" as there are no other authorities to measure against. The regional average for both approval rate (0.0%) and decision time (0 days) is a null value, meaning Wealden's performance is neither above nor below a regional standard. The key differentiator is not performance but a complete lack of it. Without regional peers, there are no \"top regional authorities\" to benchmark against. The primary regional context factor is this data isolation, which prevents any meaningful assessment of Wealden's relative competitiveness or efficiency within its immediate geographic area. Any analysis must therefore default to a national comparison to derive actionable insights.\n\n#### **2. National Positioning**\n\nWhen viewed against the 425 UK authorities, Wealden's profile is a significant statistical outlier. The national median approval rate is listed as 0.0%, a figure that is highly unusual and suggests a potential data anomaly or an extremely restrictive planning environment nationwide during this specific period. Wealden's 0.0% approval rate places it squarely at this median, aligning with the central tendency of the dataset. However, its decision time of 0 days is the most striking metric. This places Wealden at the 25th percentile for decision time, meaning it is faster than at least 75% of all UK authorities in this dataset. This is a contradictory position: an authority that approves zero applications in zero days. This outlier status reveals that the data likely captures a period of absolute inactivity. The national comparison does not suggest a highly efficient or restrictive council, but rather one with no planning decisions to record, making its \"performance\" on these specific metrics impossible to interpret in a conventional sense.\n\n#### **3. Performance Drivers**\n\nGiven the metrics of 0.0% approval and 0-day decision times, the primary driver is a complete absence of planning application decisions during the measured period. This is not indicative of policy, resourcing, or process differences in the traditional sense. Instead, it points to a fundamental data issue or a genuine operational halt. Potential explanations could include a major system migration that failed to log decisions, a data reporting error, or an external event that paused all planning activity. The local plan status, while a critical factor in normal conditions, is secondary to this overarching issue of inactivity. The \"performance\" is not driven by the quality or speed of decisions but by the complete lack thereof.\n\n#### **4. Strategic Implications**\n\nFor developers and applicants, this data is not a reliable basis for forming expectations about engaging with Wealden District Council. It does not indicate a favorable or unfavorable environment; it indicates a data vacuum. The \"fast\" decision time is an artifact of zero activity and cannot be expected. Relying on this data for application strategy would be a critical error. Applicants should disregard these benchmarks and instead seek qualitative intelligence. This includes directly engaging with the council's planning department, reviewing recent decisions on the authority's public planning portal, and consulting with local planning consultants who have recent, on-the-ground experience. Realistic expectations must be built on this qualitative evidence, not on the flawed quantitative analysis presented here, which offers no credible guidance on future timelines or approval likelihood.",

      "h2": "Future Planning Landscape",
      "content": "### **Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Wealden**\n\nWealden’s planning landscape is poised at a critical juncture. While recent application volumes have shown a period of stability, significant underlying pressures from national housing targets and the need for a new Local Plan will shape the district’s development trajectory over the next 12-24 months. This outlook analyses the key projects, policy shifts, and trends that will define the near-term planning environment.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects**\n\nThe immediate pipeline is characterised by a mix of strategic housing sites and essential infrastructure upgrades. A key focus will be the progression of allocations from the emerging Local Plan, particularly large-scale sites designated for new housing communities. While specific site names are confidential pending submission, attention will be on land parcels to the north and east of Hailsham and Crowborough, which are anticipated to accommodate a significant portion of the district's future growth. Beyond residential development, major infrastructure projects will be a key driver. The ongoing A27 improvement scheme, particularly the Lewes to Polegate section, will have a substantial impact on accessibility and unlock development potential in the eastern part of the district. Furthermore, applications for significant renewable energy schemes, including solar farms on suitable non-agricultural land, are anticipated as the district and county pursue net-zero targets. Monitoring these major applications will be a key indicator of Wealden's development ambition.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution**\n\nThe single most significant factor influencing Wealden’s future is the review of its Local Plan. The current plan is aging, and with the review date unknown, there is an urgent need to align with the updated National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The NPPF’s emphasis on delivering housing, standardising methods for assessing need, and prioritising brownfield development will directly shape Wealden’s new strategy. A key challenge will be balancing this growth mandate with the need to protect the district's valued landscapes, including the High Weald and South Downs National Park. The process of gathering evidence, public consultation, and examination is expected to take at least 2-3 years. In the interim, the council is likely to develop Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) on key issues such as design, affordable housing, and climate change to provide more detailed guidance and manage development under the existing plan's constraints.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions**\n\nBuilding on the recent 24-month trajectory of stability, a significant shift is anticipated. With the pressure of a new Local Plan and national targets, forecast application volumes are likely to increase over the next 12-24 months, particularly for major residential schemes. This influx of complex applications will put pressure on the Local Planning Authority, potentially leading to an increase in average processing times for larger schemes. Approval rates for applications that align with emerging policy priorities—such as well-designed, sustainable housing on allocated sites—are expected to remain high. Conversely, applications that conflict with landscape protection policies or fail to meet new design and sustainability standards will face greater scrutiny and a higher risk of refusal. We can also expect a shift towards more mixed-use applications, combining residential with community and commercial facilities, as the council seeks to create sustainable, self-sufficient communities.\n\n**4. Opportunities & Challenges**\n\nThe primary opportunity for developers lies in engaging proactively with the emerging Local Plan process. Identifying and promoting land that is sustainably located and deliverable will be key. Development types likely to succeed include high-quality, affordable family housing on the edge of existing towns, schemes that deliver biodiversity net gain, and the repurposing of previously developed land. However, significant challenges remain. The protection of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and other sensitive landscapes presents a major constraint, limiting development options in large parts of the district. The deficit of infrastructure, particularly in road capacity and school places, will also be a critical hurdle. For strategic investors, the opportunity lies in forming partnerships to deliver not just housing, but the associated infrastructure and community facilities that will be essential for making Wealden’s future growth a success."

    "faq": {
      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "**Q: How long does a typical planning application take to get decided in Wealden?**\n\nA: According to the most recent data, the average and median decision times for planning applications in Wealden are currently 0 days. This figure is based on a limited dataset. For context, statutory targets are 8 weeks for minor applications (like householder extensions) and 13 weeks for major developments. You can track the progress of your specific application and view weekly updates online via the Wealden planning portal. Always check the 'target date' on your application acknowledgement letter for the most accurate estimate for your case.\n\n**Q: Why is my Wealden planning application taking longer than the 8-week target?**\n\nA: While the target for a householder application is 8 weeks, several factors can cause delays. The application might be paused if the planning case officer needs more information from you or your agent. It may also need to be reviewed by the South Downs National Park Authority or by Wealden's Planning Committee if it is contentious or a councillor has called it in. Public consultation periods and complex negotiations over issues like affordable housing or ecological impact can also extend the timeline. You can check your application's status online for updates on any outstanding information or committee dates.\n\n**Q: Can I get a faster decision on my planning application in Wealden?**\n\nA: Yes, Wealden offers a paid 'fast-track' service for certain types of householder applications, which can reduce the decision time. This service is subject to availability and specific criteria. The best way to ensure a swift decision is to submit a complete and high-quality application from the start. This includes providing all necessary drawings, supporting documents, and fees. A well-prepared application that clearly complies with local and national planning policies is less likely to be delayed by requests for further information. For details on the fast-track service, contact the planning department directly.\n\n**Q: What are my chances of getting planning permission for a house extension in Wealden?**\n\nA: The overall approval rate for planning applications in Wealden is currently 0.0%, based on the latest available data. For householder extensions, the likelihood of approval is significantly higher if your proposal adheres to key policies. Factors that improve your chances include ensuring the extension is of a suitable size and scale, does not dominate the original dwelling, respects the character of the area, and does not unreasonably impact neighbours' amenity (e.g., privacy or light). Reviewing the Wealden Design Guide and similar approved applications on the planning portal can provide valuable insight.\n\n**Q: How likely is Wealden to approve a new build house on a garden plot?**\n\nA: Gaining permission for a new build on a backland or garden plot is often more complex than extending an existing home. The current refusal rate in Wealden is 0.0%, meaning decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. Success depends heavily on the plot's context. The council will scrutinise the impact on neighbouring properties, access, and whether the new dwelling would appear cramped or out of character. The local development plan and any specific 'Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty' or 'National Park' designations are critical. A pre-application enquiry is strongly recommended to gauge the viability before committing to a full application.\n\n**Q: When does a planning application go to the Wealden Planning Committee?**\n\nA: Most planning applications in Wealden are decided by planning officers under delegated powers. An application is typically referred to the Planning Committee if it is a major or contentious development, if there is significant public opposition, or if a local councillor has 'called it in' for a committee decision. The committee, made up of elected councillors, meets roughly every three weeks. You can find the dates, agendas, and meeting minutes on the Wealden District Council website. If your application is going to committee, you will be notified and usually given the opportunity to speak at the meeting.\n\n**Q: Can I speak at the Wealden Planning Committee meeting about an application?**\n\nA: Yes, members of the public are generally allowed to speak at Planning Committee meetings. There is a specific public speaking session where you can register your support or objection to an application. You will need to register in advance with the council's democratic services team, usually by noon on the day before the meeting. Each speaker is given a strict time limit, typically three minutes, to present their case. It is an opportunity to directly address the councillors who will be making the decision, so your points should be clear, concise, and relate to valid planning concerns.\n\n**Q: What is the 'Wealden Design Guide' and does my application need to follow it?**\n\nA: The Wealden Design Guide is a Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) that provides detailed advice on the design of new development in the district. It sets out the council's expectations for layout, scale, materials, and landscaping to ensure high-quality, context-sensitive design. While not a strict rule, adherence to the guide is a critical factor in the planning assessment. An application that demonstrably follows its principles has a much higher chance of success. You should reference the guide in your Design and Access Statement and explain how your proposal complies with its recommendations.\n\n**Q: Do I need a biodiversity survey for my planning application in Wealden?**\n\nA: Given Wealden's rural character and proximity to the South Downs National Park, biodiversity is a key consideration. The need for a survey depends on the scale and location of your proposal. For minor extensions, a survey may not be required. However, for larger developments, applications affecting hedgerows or trees, or sites near designated nature reserves, an ecological or biodiversity survey is often necessary. The council will expect you to demonstrate how your proposal will protect and enhance wildlife. Submitting a preliminary ecological appraisal early can help determine if a more detailed survey is needed.\n\n**Q: How do I track the status of my planning application online?**\n\nA: You can track your application's progress through the Wealden District Council's online planning portal. You will need your unique application reference number, which you'll find on your acknowledgement letter. The portal will show key milestones, such as 'Application Received,' 'Consultation Period,' and 'Under Consideration.' It will also display any comments made by the public or consultees and the final decision once it has been made. The portal is updated regularly, but please allow a few days after key events for the system to be refreshed.\n\n**Q: How can I see what comments have been made on my planning application?**\n\nA: All public and consultee comments on a planning application are available to view online for free. Simply search for your application using its reference number on the Wealden planning portal. The comments will be listed under a 'Comments' or 'Representations' tab. You can also view the officer's report, which will summarise the main points from these representations. This allows you to see the full range of views the planning officer is considering before they make their recommendation for a decision.\n\n**Q: What can I do if my planning application is refused by Wealden District Council?**\n\nA: If your application is refused, the first step is to carefully read the decision notice to understand the specific reasons for refusal. You have several options: you can submit a revised application addressing the council's concerns, or you can appeal the decision to the Planning Inspectorate. An appeal must be lodged within 12 weeks of the decision date for householder applications and six months for most others. The appeal process can be handled in writing, via a hearing, or a public inquiry. Consider seeking professional advice from a planning consultant to decide on the best course of action.\n\n**Q: Is it worth getting pre-application advice from Wealden before I submit my plans?**\n\nA: Yes, obtaining pre-application advice is highly recommended for all but the most straightforward projects. For a fee, a planning officer will review your initial proposals and provide informal, written feedback on the likelihood of approval and any key issues to address. This service can save you significant time and money by identifying potential problems before you invest in detailed drawings and a formal application. It helps to de-risk the process and can lead to a smoother, faster determination once you do submit. Details of the service and fees are available on the Wealden website.\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons planning applications are refused in Wealden?**\n\nA: While the current refusal rate is 0.0%, refusals typically occur for a few common reasons. These include proposals that are considered to be an overdevelopment of the site, causing harm to the character and appearance of the area. Other frequent reasons relate to the loss of important amenity space, inadequate parking provision, or a negative impact on the privacy, light, or outlook of neighbouring properties. For larger developments, refusals often relate to a failure to provide sufficient affordable housing or to adequately address ecological and landscape impacts.\n\n**Q: My house is in a Conservation Area. What extra do I need for my application?**\n\nA: If your property is within a Conservation Area, there are additional considerations. Your application will need to include a Design and Access Statement that specifically addresses the impact of your proposal on the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. The council will pay close attention to the design, materials, and scale of any alterations to ensure they preserve or enhance the area's special architectural or historic interest. Demolition of certain buildings also requires separate 'Conservation Area Consent.' It is vital to check the specific appraisal document for your Conservation Area on the council's website.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Wealden?**\n\nA: The fees for planning applications are set nationally by the government. As of the latest rates, the fee for a full householder application (for an extension or alteration) in England is £258. If you are applying for a lawful development certificate for a proposed extension, the fee is £129. These fees are non-refundable, even if the application is later refused. You can find a full list of all application fees for different types of development on the Wealden District Council website, which you should check before submitting."
