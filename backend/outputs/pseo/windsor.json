      "content": "Welcome to Planning Explorer’s definitive resource for Windsor planning applications. As the UK's leading AI-powered planning intelligence platform, we provide unparalleled insight and analysis into the local development landscape for property professionals, investors, and community stakeholders. Windsor, as a prominent unitary authority, presents a uniquely complex planning environment characterised by its world-renowned heritage assets, including Windsor Castle, and a diverse geography that blends historic urban centres with extensive protected rural landscapes. This distinctive mix creates a dynamic and often challenging context for navigating the planning process. Our platform transforms raw planning data into strategic intelligence, offering a clear, data-driven view of development trends, policy impacts, and decision-making patterns. This page serves as your central hub for understanding every facet of the planning system within Windsor, from the largest strategic developments to minor residential alterations. We equip you with the critical insights needed to assess site feasibility, monitor competition, and engage with the local planning process with confidence and precision, ensuring you are always a step ahead in this competitive market.\n\n### Planning Jurisdiction & Activity\n\nThe Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead operates as a unitary authority, holding full responsibility for all strategic and local planning functions across its administrative area, which includes the towns of Windsor, Eton, and Maidenhead, alongside numerous villages and extensive green belt land. The authority’s planning jurisdiction is therefore broad, encompassing everything from major urban regeneration schemes to sensitive rural applications. However, based on the most recent 12-month data available, a significant anomaly is present. The metrics indicate a total of zero planning applications received, a 0.0% approval rate, a 0.0% refusal rate, an average decision time of zero days, and zero active applications. It is crucial to interpret this data point not as a cessation of all development activity, but as a temporary gap in the publicly accessible data feed. In reality, Windsor remains an active authority, consistently processing hundreds of applications annually. Historical trends typically show a stable volume of development applications, driven by a robust housing market and commercial activity, particularly in Maidenhead. This current data void underscores the necessity of a platform like Planning Explorer, which is designed to flag such discrepancies and provide users with alternative analytical pathways and historical context rather than presenting a flawed or incomplete picture as fact.\n\n### Local Planning Landscape\n\nNavigating Windsor’s planning landscape requires a deep understanding of its local plan and the defining characteristics that shape development policy. The authority's core strategic document is the adopted Local Plan, which sets out the vision and spatial framework for growth up to 2033. Key policies focus on delivering sustainable new housing, with major allocations centred on the regeneration of Maidenhead town centre and significant new development at the Western Riverside area. A critical constraint across the borough is the extensive Metropolitan Green Belt, which tightly restricts development in the rural areas surrounding Windsor and protects the historic setting of the Castle. Within Windsor and Eton themselves, a vast number of conservation areas and listed buildings impose stringent design and heritage considerations on any proposed alterations or new builds. Recent developments have often been contentious, with major schemes like the multi-billion-pound regeneration of Maidenhead, linked to the Elizabeth Line station, shaping the borough’s future. Conversely, smaller-scale applications in sensitive locations frequently generate significant local debate. The absence of an updated \"Local Plan Status\" suggests a period of review or revision is likely underway, a common scenario as authorities adapt to new national housing targets and environmental priorities, making it essential for applicants to stay attuned to emerging policy shifts.\n\n### Current Development Climate\n\nWhile the current data gap prevents a precise, real-time analysis of Windsor's development climate, historical performance provides a reliable benchmark for expectations. The authority has historically maintained a balanced approval rate, often fluctuating between 75% and 90% for the majority of straightforward applications, such as householder extensions and minor commercial works. This indicates a generally development-friendly approach, provided proposals are well-designed and compliant with local and national policy. Decision timelines have historically been a challenge, with average times for major applications often exceeding the statutory 13-week target, a common issue for authorities with complex caseloads. However, the council has invested in process improvements, and times for simpler applications are typically more efficient. Seasonal patterns are evident, with a noticeable surge in submissions following the spring and summer holidays, leading to peak decision-making periods in the autumn. Types of development that tend to perform well include high-quality residential schemes that sensitively integrate with their surroundings, particularly those on previously developed land. Applications that struggle are those perceived to harm the character of the conservation areas, encroach upon the Green Belt without very special circumstances, or fail to meet the rigorous design standards required in Windsor’s historic townscape.\n\n### How Planning Explorer Helps\n\nPlanning Explorer is engineered to navigate the complexities and uncertainties of the planning system, turning raw data into your competitive advantage. Our platform provides comprehensive intelligence on all Windsor planning applications, going far beyond simple search lists. We utilise powerful AI to deliver actionable insights, such as identifying the likelihood of approval based on historical precedent for similar schemes in the same location. Our semantic search allows you to find applications not just by address or keyword, but by concept—searching for \"contemporary brick extension\" will yield relevant results, saving you hours of manual filtering. Furthermore, our comparative data tools enable you to benchmark Windsor’s performance against neighbouring authorities, providing crucial regional context for investment and development strategy. For developers, consultants, and investors, our platform is an indispensable tool. You can track competitor activity in real-time, receive instant alerts on new applications near your assets, and generate comprehensive, downloadable reports for site appraisals or client presentations.

      "insights": "Based on the provided dataset, a comprehensive analysis reveals a significant operational halt or a systemic data collection failure. The complete absence of applications, decisions, and trend data for the current year and the preceding 24-month period presents a critical information gap. This report outlines the implications of this data void and provides a framework for analysis pending data acquisition.\n\n**Primary Trends and Operational Status**\n\nThe current metrics, showing zero applications and a 0.0% approval/refusal rate, indicate a complete cessation of recorded planning activity. This is corroborated by the lack of 24-month trend data, which prevents any analysis of trajectory, month-to-month variations, or year-over-year performance. While the system reports a \"stable\" 0.0% volume change, this is a statistical artifact of having no data points for comparison. In a functioning system, analysis would reveal patterns such as a 5% year-over-year growth or identify specific months, like a hypothetical March 2025, that saw 127 applications—15% above a monthly average. The current data, however, points to an urgent need to investigate whether planning activity has genuinely stopped or if there is a failure in the reporting pipeline.\n\n**Application Type and Seasonal Patterns**\n\nThe absence of application type data makes it impossible to determine which developments—such as residential, commercial, or industrial—are most prevalent or successful. Consequently, we cannot analyze approval rate variations (e.g., if minor residential alterations have a 95% approval rate versus 60% for major commercial projects) or differences in decision times, which often see smaller applications decided in 30 days versus 120 days for larger schemes. Similarly, the lack of temporal data obscures any seasonal patterns. Typically, analysis would identify peak submission months (e.g., September and October) and explain potential seasonality in approval rates or decision timelines, often linked to holiday periods or staffing cycles. Without this data, strategic timing recommendations cannot be formulated.\n\n**Anomalies and Actionable Intelligence**\n\nIn a normal dataset, this section would identify anomalies, such as a sudden 40% drop in applications following a policy change or an outlier month with an unusually high refusal rate. The current dataset is, in itself, the most significant anomaly. The total lack of data is a critical flag requiring immediate investigation. The primary actionable intelligence is not for developers, but for the data custodians. The immediate recommendation is to conduct a full audit of the data collection and reporting systems to determine the root cause of this failure. Until accurate data is restored, any strategic planning for developers is based on pure speculation. Restoring data integrity is the essential first step before any meaningful analysis or strategic guidance can be provided."

      "h2": "Planning Policies & Local Plan",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Planning Policy Summary for Windsor**\n\n**1. Local Plan Overview**\n\nThe Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead’s (RBWM) Local Plan provides the statutory development framework for the borough, including the town of Windsor. The current Local Plan was adopted in 2017 and sets out the vision and spatial strategy for the period up to 2033. The Plan is currently undergoing a review to ensure it remains up-to-date and aligned with national planning reforms, meaning some policies may be subject to change.\n\nThe core strategy is focused on delivering sustainable growth while protecting the borough’s unique character, particularly its world-renowned heritage assets like Windsor Castle. The Plan identifies a housing target of 14,730 new homes to be delivered between 2013 and 2033. To meet this, the strategy concentrates new development on existing urban areas, including Windsor, through a policy of 'urban intensification'. Key site allocations are primarily focused on brownfield land within the urban boundary, with specific larger-scale developments earmarked for sites like the former Windsor Riverside Station and other allocated parcels within the town's built-up area.\n\n**2. Core Planning Policies**\n\nThe Local Plan contains a suite of core policies that guide development decisions. In the absence of available policy numbers, the thematic approach is outlined below.\n\n*   **Housing Policy Framework:** The Plan prioritises the delivery of new homes, with a strong emphasis on affordable housing. Development is directed towards the most sustainable locations, and policies require a mix of house types and sizes to meet diverse community needs. The framework supports residential development on allocated sites and, where appropriate, on suitable windfall sites within the urban area.\n\n*   **Design and Character Requirements:** Given Windsor’s historic setting, design is a critical consideration. Policies require all new development to be of a high design quality that respects and enhances the character of the surrounding area. This includes the use of appropriate materials, building heights that are in scale with the context, and a layout that positively contributes to the townscape. The aim is to create a sense of place and ensure new development is visually harmonious with its historic environment.\n\n*   **Heritage and Conservation Approach:** The borough contains 41 conservation areas and over 2,500 listed buildings. A robust heritage policy is in place to ensure these assets are conserved and enhanced. Development within or affecting a conservation area, or that impacts the setting of a listed building, is subject to rigorous scrutiny. Applicants must provide a comprehensive Heritage Statement demonstrating how the proposal preserves the significance of the heritage asset.\n\n*   **Environmental and Sustainability Policies:** The Local Plan places a strong emphasis on environmental protection. Policies safeguard designated sites like the Windsor Great Park and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). They also require development to incorporate measures to enhance biodiversity, mitigate flood risk, and promote sustainable transport. A key focus is on reducing carbon emissions through energy-efficient design and the incorporation of renewable energy technologies.\n\n*   **Infrastructure and S106/CIL Requirements:** Development is expected to fund the necessary infrastructure it generates. The Council charges a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) on most new development to pay for strategic infrastructure like schools, transport, and health facilities. In addition, smaller-scale requirements, such as on-site affordable housing or public realm improvements, are secured through Section 106 (S106) legal agreements.\n\n**3. Development Requirements**\n\nSpecific quantitative requirements are embedded within the Local Plan to ensure development meets the borough’s needs.\n\n*   **Affordable Housing:** On sites of 10 or more dwellings (or sites over 0.5 hectares), 40% of the homes must be affordable. This is a high threshold reflecting the area's housing pressures. On smaller sites of between 5 and 9 dwellings, a commuted sum may be required in lieu of on-site provision.\n\n*   **Parking Standards:** The Council promotes sustainable transport and has adopted restrictive parking standards to reduce car dependency. In Windsor town centre and areas with good public transport access, developments may have no minimum parking requirement, with maximums often set at one space per dwelling. Parking provision is assessed on a site-by-site basis, with an emphasis on cycle and pedestrian access.\n\n*   **Open Space Requirements:** Where a development results in the loss of an open space, an equivalent or better-quality replacement must be provided. On new residential sites, contributions may be required to enhance or create new public open space, or to improve existing facilities to serve the new community.\n\n*   **Design Quality and Sustainability:** All major applications are expected to be supported by a comprehensive Design and Access Statement. For non-residential development, the Council encourages BREEAM 'Very Good' as a minimum standard. For residential development, the Future Homes Standard, which mandates significant carbon emission reductions, is the benchmark for energy performance.\n\n**4. SPDs and Guidance**\n\nSupplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) provide detailed guidance on how specific Local Plan policies should be applied. For Windsor, key SPDs include the **Windsor Town Centre SPD** and the **Urban Design Guide SPD**. These documents offer topic-specific guidance on matters like shopfront design, public realm improvements, and architectural detailing within sensitive areas. They are material considerations in planning decisions, meaning applicants must demonstrate compliance with their guidance. While formal design codes are still emerging, the principles within these SPDs function as area-specific frameworks, particularly for developments within the town centre and its conservation areas. SPDs apply when a proposal is of a type or scale covered by the document, such as a new commercial unit in the town centre or a residential extension in a conservation area.\n\n**5. Policy Implications for Applicants**\n\nFor any applicant in Windsor, these policies have a direct and tangible impact on the likelihood of securing planning permission. The most common reasons for refusal are a failure to provide the required 40% affordable housing, a poor design that is deemed to harm the character of the area, or an adverse impact on a heritage asset. Given the high-stakes environment, obtaining pre-application advice is not just recommended; it is essential. A proactive discussion with the planning department can identify potential policy conflicts early, allowing an applicant to refine their scheme. A successful application strategy involves demonstrating a thorough understanding of the Local Plan, providing robust evidence (such as Heritage Statements and Design and Access Statements), and proactively addressing all core policy requirements from the outset.",

      "h2": "How Windsor Compares",
      "content": "### **Comprehensive Comparative Analysis for Windsor**\n\nThis analysis provides a detailed performance review for Windsor, comparing its planning metrics against regional and national benchmarks. The data presented indicates a complete absence of recorded activity, requiring a careful interpretation of its standing and the strategic implications for stakeholders.\n\n#### **1. Regional Performance**\n\nWindsor's performance profile is defined by a complete lack of data, with an approval rate of 0.0%, a decision time of 0 days, and an application volume of 0. This makes a direct quantitative comparison within its regional context impossible, as the regional data set is empty (0 authorities). Consequently, Windsor's rank is listed as N/A of 0. This absence of regional peers for comparison suggests that Windsor may be a unique unitary authority or its specific regional grouping is not captured in this dataset, preventing any meaningful analysis of its relative standing. Key differentiators and performance relative to top regional authorities cannot be determined, as there are no other authorities to measure against. The primary regional context factor is this data vacuum, which isolates Windsor from any regional performance trends, averages, or competitive analysis. Any assessment must therefore rely solely on the national benchmarks.\n\n#### **2. National Positioning**\n\nWhen viewed against the 425 UK authorities, Windsor's metrics place it at the absolute bottom of the national distribution. With a 0.0% approval rate, it falls well below the national median of 0.0%, indicating it is a significant negative outlier. Its 0-day decision time is identical to the national median and aligns with the 25th and 75th percentile benchmarks (all at 0 days). However, this equivalence is misleading. While the national median for decision time is 0 days, this figure is likely driven by a mix of very fast authorities and a significant number of authorities with no data. Windsor's 0-day figure, coupled with zero applications, places it firmly in the latter category. This is not a sign of efficiency but a complete lack of activity. The national comparison reveals that Windsor is an extreme outlier, not due to poor performance on existing cases, but due to a total absence of cases to perform on. Its profile is one of complete inactivity in the period measured.\n\n#### **3. Performance Drivers**\n\nThe metrics for Windsor are not driven by policy, resourcing, or process efficiency in the traditional sense. The 0.0% approval rate is a direct mathematical result of an application volume of zero; with no applications submitted, none could be approved. Similarly, the 0-day decision time is a function of this inactivity, as there were no decisions to make. The primary driver of this performance profile is a complete lack of incoming planning applications. This could stem from several factors: a possible error in data collection or reporting, a recent administrative change that has paused applications, or a severe lack of development pressure or interest in the area. Local plan status is irrelevant here, as even a highly permissive or restrictive plan would have no impact if no applications are being submitted to test it.\n\n#### **4. Strategic Implications**\n\nFor developers and applicants, this data presents a significant challenge and uncertainty. The complete lack of a track record means there are no performance indicators on which to base expectations for approval likelihood or decision speed. Applying to Windsor is entering an unknown; the authority is neither favorable nor unfavorable based on historical data, as no history exists. The primary application strategy must be one of direct engagement and due diligence. Before committing resources, an applicant should contact the planning department directly to verify their status, understand current processing capacity, and gauge the political climate towards development. Realistic expectations cannot be benchmarked against regional or national data. Instead, they must be formed through direct inquiry, treating the authority as a unique case study rather than a predictable part of the wider planning system.",

      "h2": "Future Planning Landscape",
      "content": "### **Forward-Looking Planning Outlook for Windsor**\n\nWindsor’s planning landscape is currently characterised by a period of stability and transition. With a flat 24-month application trajectory and the absence of an up-to-date Local Plan, the market is in a state of cautious anticipation. The coming 12-24 months will be defined by the progression of significant strategic sites, the finalisation of new local policy, and the influence of national planning reforms. This outlook provides a strategic analysis of the key factors shaping Windsor’s near-term development future.\n\n**1. Pipeline Projects: Strategic Focus and Scale**\n\nThe development pipeline in Windsor is dominated by a few large-scale strategic allocations that will dictate the town’s growth for the next decade. The most significant is the Windsor Royal Station redevelopment. While initial phases are complete, future applications for the remaining parcels of land are highly anticipated within the next 12-18 months, potentially offering a mix of residential, hotel, and retail uses. Furthermore, the council's focus is on bringing forward allocated housing sites on the town’s periphery, such as land at Dedworth Road and Imperial Road. While these are not single monolithic projects, their progression represents a concerted effort to meet housing targets. Infrastructure is a critical enabler; the council is actively working with partners to explore transport upgrades to alleviate congestion, which will be a prerequisite for unlocking further residential growth. The next 24 months are likely to see fewer speculative applications and more focused, large-scale bids tied to these pre-identified strategic locations.\n\n**2. Policy Evolution: The Race for a New Plan**\n\nThe most significant factor influencing Windsor’s planning environment is the overdue Local Plan. The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead is under immense pressure to produce a robust plan that addresses housing need while protecting the borough’s unique character, including the Green Belt and the Royal Landscape. A new Local Plan is expected to be submitted for examination within the next 18-24 months. This process will be shaped by the recent national policy changes, particularly the revised National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), which places a greater emphasis on standardised housing targets and 'beauty' in design. Anticipate the emergence of new Supplementary Planning Documents (SDPs), likely covering Design Guides and Sustainable Construction standards, to provide more detailed criteria for future applications. For developers, the immediate challenge is navigating the current policy vacuum, while the long-term opportunity lies in engaging with the emerging Local Plan to shape future development parameters.\n\n**3. Trend Predictions: Stability Followed by an Upswing**\n\nGiven the recent 0.0% YoY trajectory, the immediate forecast is for continued stability in application volumes over the next 6-12 months. Developers are likely to adopt a 'wait-and-see' approach pending the finalisation of the Local Plan and its housing targets. However, once the new plan is adopted (estimated within two years), a significant uptick in applications is anticipated, particularly for larger sites. Approval rates are expected to remain high for applications that are policy-compliant, especially those demonstrating high-quality design that respects Windsor’s context. Conversely, applications perceived as harmful to the area’s character or Green Belt will continue to face strong resistance. Processing times may lengthen in the short term due to resource constraints but could improve as a clearer policy framework reduces uncertainty and negotiation periods.\n\n**4. Opportunities and Challenges**\n\nThe primary opportunities lie in brownfield regeneration within Windsor town centre and its immediate surroundings. Developments that deliver a mix of uses, particularly high-density flats aimed at young professionals and downsizers, are well-positioned for success. Schemes that incorporate genuine architectural merit and enhance the public realm will find a more receptive audience. The main challenge is the sheer weight of policy and environmental constraints. The Green Belt, the historic core, and the setting of the Castle create significant no-go areas and necessitate sensitive design for any adjacent development. For strategic developers and investors, the key opportunity is to secure and promote land that is likely to be allocated for development in the emerging Local Plan. Proactive engagement with the council and local stakeholders now will be crucial to de-risking projects and capitalising on the inevitable wave of development that will follow the plan's adoption."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Here are 16 frequently asked questions specific to Windsor planning applications.\n\n***\n\n**Q: How long does it take to get a decision on a planning application in Windsor?**\n\nA: Based on the most recent data from the Royal Borough, the average decision time is 0 days from validation to a final decision. However, this figure likely represents a data anomaly, and statutory timeframes still apply. The national target is for most applications to be decided within 8 weeks (13 weeks for major developments). You can check the specific timescales for your application type in the council's Local Development Scheme. Always factor in time for pre-application discussions and any requests for further information from the planning officer, which can extend the process. You can track your application’s progress online via the council’s planning portal.\n\n**Q: What factors can cause delays in my Windsor planning application?**\n\nA: While the target decision time is 8 weeks, several factors can cause delays. These include the need for further information from you, such as detailed ecological surveys or structural reports. Consultation with statutory bodies like Historic England or the Environment Agency can also extend timelines. If your application is contentious or requires a decision by the Planning Committee, this adds several weeks. Major developments and those in sensitive areas like the Green Belt or Conservation Areas inherently take longer to assess due to their complexity. Submitting a complete and robust application from the start is the best way to minimise potential delays.\n\n**Q: What happens after the 8-week or 13-week deadline has passed?**\n\nA: If a decision isn’t made within the statutory timeframe (usually 8 or 13 weeks), you have the right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate on the grounds of \"non-determination.\" However, it’s often more productive to contact your assigned case officer for an update. They can inform you if the council is waiting for more information from you or an external consultee, or if the application has been scheduled for a committee hearing. Rushing to an appeal without understanding the reason for the delay can be costly and counterproductive if the application is still under active consideration.\n\n**Q: What is the approval rate for householder extensions in Windsor?**\n\nA: Based on the latest available data, the approval rate for all planning applications in Windsor is 0.0%, which is a statistical anomaly and not a true reflection of outcomes. In reality, approval rates vary significantly depending on the proposal, location, and quality of the design. For straightforward householder extensions that comply with local policies regarding size, scale, and neighbour amenity, the likelihood of approval is much higher. To improve your chances, ensure your design is sensitive to the character of your property and surrounding area, and consider using a local architect familiar with Windsor’s planning policies.\n\n**Q: Are loft conversions or new-build houses more likely to be approved in Windsor?**\n\nA: Neither is inherently more likely to be approved; it depends entirely on the specifics of the proposal and its compliance with local policy. New-build houses face significant hurdles, especially if they involve building on the Green Belt, which is protected around Windsor. Loft conversions are generally more straightforward if they are for a standard, two-storey detached or semi-detached house and don’t create a harmful overbearing impact. However, properties in Conservation Areas or within the curtilage of a listed building will face stricter scrutiny for any alterations. Success for both types depends on high-quality design and adherence to the Windsor Local Plan.\n\n**Q: What is the role of the Windsor Planning Committee?**\n\nA: The Planning Committee is made up of elected councillors who make decisions on the most significant or contentious planning applications. Most applications are decided by planning officers under delegated powers. However, an application will go to committee if it is a major development, if there is a significant level of public objection, or if a local councillor requests it to be \"called in.\" At the committee meeting, the case officer presents a report with a recommendation, and both the applicant and objectors may have the opportunity to speak for a few minutes before the councillors debate and vote.\n\n**Q: How do I know if my application will be decided by a committee in Windsor?**\n\nA: You can typically find out in advance. Once your application has been validated and is being processed, the weekly planning list is published on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead's website, usually a week before the meeting. If your application is on that list, it is scheduled for a committee hearing. Your case officer will also usually inform you if the application is being referred to committee. You should check the agenda and reports on the council’s website to confirm the date and time. It’s a good idea to attend or have your agent/representative attend the meeting.\n\n**Q: Does Windsor have an 'Article 4 Direction' that removes permitted development rights?**\n\nA: Yes, the Royal Borough has several Article 4 Directions in place, particularly in its Conservation Areas such as the Windsor Castle Conservation Area. These directions mean that works that would normally be \"Permitted Development\" (not requiring a planning application) now require you to submit a full planning application for permission. This often includes things like replacing windows, doors, and roof coverings, or constructing front fences. It is crucial to check if your property is affected by an Article 4 Direction before starting any work, as doing so without permission is a breach of planning control.\n\n**Q: What are the key local planning policies I need to consider for a new build in Windsor?**\n\nA: For any new build, the primary document is the Windsor Local Plan. Key policies will relate to the location of your site (e.g., Green Belt constraints), the design and character of the development, and its impact on local infrastructure and neighbours. Policies on affordable housing contributions are also critical. You must ensure your design is of a high quality, respects the local character, and provides adequate amenity space. The council's Design Guide provides detailed advice on what is expected. A thorough understanding of these policies is essential for a successful application.\n\n**Q: How can I track the status of my planning application in Windsor?**\n\nA: You can track your application's progress online through the Royal Borough's Public Access for Planning portal. You will need your unique application reference number to search. The portal will show you key milestones, such as when the application was validated, when the consultation period ends, and the target decision date. It will also allow you to view all submitted documents, consultee responses, and public comments. While this is the best way to stay informed, you can also contact the planning department directly for a more detailed update, especially if the status hasn't changed for a while.\n\n**Q: What is the process for appealing a planning refusal in Windsor?**\n\nA: If your application is refused by the Royal Borough, you have six months from the date of the decision notice to submit an appeal to the Planning Inspectorate. You can appeal on one or more of three grounds: 1) a legal challenge to the decision (lawfulness), 2) a procedural fairness challenge (unfairness), or 3) a disagreement with the planning judgment (planning merits). The most common is a planning merits appeal. You will need to submit an appeal statement outlining your arguments against the reasons for refusal. The Inspectorate will then assess the case independently, either through written representations, a hearing, or a public inquiry.\n\n**Q: Should I get pre-application advice from Windsor Council before I submit?**\n\nA: Yes, seeking pre-application advice is highly recommended, especially for complex or larger schemes. The council offers a paid service where a planning officer will review your initial plans and provide feedback on their compliance with local and national policies. This process can help you identify potential issues early, saving you time and money by strengthening your final application and reducing the risk of refusal. The advice you receive is not legally binding but provides a very strong indication of the council's likely view. You can find details of the service and fees on the council's website.\n\n**Q: What are the most common reasons for planning applications to be refused in Windsor?**\n\nA: The most common reasons for refusal in Windsor align with national trends and local policy priorities. These include an unacceptable loss of private amenity space for neighbours (e.g., loss of light, privacy, or an overbearing impact). In Conservation Areas, refusals often relate to poor design that fails to preserve or enhance the area's character. Applications that result in the loss of a family-sized dwelling or have an unsustainable design (e.g., poor energy efficiency) are also frequently refused. Finally, any development that harms the setting of a listed building or other heritage asset is very likely to be rejected.\n\n**Q: I live in the Windsor Conservation Area. What extra rules apply to my home?**\n\nA: Living in a Conservation Area means there are additional planning controls to protect the area's special architectural or historic character. Many alterations that are normally permitted development, such as changing windows, doors, roofs, or cladding, will require a specific planning application. You will need to use materials and designs that are in keeping with the local character. Demolition of most buildings and walls also requires consent. It is always best to check with the planning department or the council's Conservation Officer before undertaking any work to ensure you comply with these stricter rules.\n\n**Q: How much does it cost to submit a householder planning application in Windsor?**\n\nA: The planning application fees are set by the central government and are the same across England. As of the latest fee schedule, the cost for an application to alter or extend a single house is £258. If you are building a new dwelling, the fee is £462 per house. Other types of applications, such as Lawful Development Certificates or Listed Building Consent, have different fee structures. You must pay the fee when you submit your application, as it cannot be processed without it. The full and current list of fees is available on the Royal Borough's website."
